By Glory Abuh-adejoh  Abuja   –    A Wuse Zone 6 Chief Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, on Friday fixed Aug.27 for trial of one Gift Donye, docked for alleged tampering of Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) prepaid meter. When the case was called up, the defendant’s counsel, Ponsak Bigon, told the court that he had not been served with proof of evidence that he intended to rely on in the case. Bigon requested for a short adjournment, which the prosecution counsel, PureHeart Aganaenwere, did not oppose. The Chief Magistrate, Theresa Otu, ordered that the defendant’s counsel be served with the proof of evidence before the next adjourned date. She adjourned the case until Aug. 27 for hearing. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the defendant was arraigned on July 4 on a count charge bordering on vandalism. The prosecution alleged that the defendant on the same day tampered with the AEDC prepaid meter in her residence, in order to slow down the reading of the meter to her advantage. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge and was granted bail in the sum of N100,000 with a surety in like sum. The offence contravened the provisions of Section 286, sub (2) of the Penal Code.
