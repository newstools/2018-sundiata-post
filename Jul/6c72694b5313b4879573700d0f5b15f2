By Peter Okolie Awka –   The Trade Union Congress (TUC) of Nigeria, Anambra Council, has re-elected Mr Ifeanyi Okechukwu as its Chairman for a second tenure. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Okechukwu was returned unopposed at the state TUC Triennial Delegates Conference in Awka on Monday. The Assistant Secretary-General of the Union, Mr Anthony Ebaho, who supervised the electoral process, commended the members for their mature and peaceful conduct. Ebaho said the unanimous decision by the delegates to return the executive was an indication of quality leadership and good harmonious relationship existing between the executive council and members. In his acceptance speech, Okechukwu assured members that his executive would continue to employ dialogue and non-confrontational approach with the government on issues of members’ welfare. Okechukwu said he ensured a cordial relationship between the state government, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), security agencies and business organisations in the state in his first three years. “This transformed the TUC to a major stakeholder in the affairs of the state.” Okechukwu, who doubles as the Chairman, Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria (ASCSN), Anambra chapter, commended Gov. Willie Obiano for the prompt payment of pensions and salaries to workers. He, however, urged the Federal Government to urgently address security challenges currently ravaging some parts of the country. NAN reports that other officers re-elected included Chris Ogbonna (Vice Chairman), David Nwaogorugor (Secretary), Uzoh Odilichukwu (Treasurer), and Eweh Onyedika (Financial Secretary). Others are Uche Mba (Public Relations Officer), Ben Ebi-Alex (Assistant Secretary), Mrs Nneka Nwankwo (Chairperson, Women), and Obiakor Ogochukwu (Ex-Officio member).  (NAN)
