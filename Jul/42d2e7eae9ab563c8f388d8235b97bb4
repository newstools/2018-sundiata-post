By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  FIFA has issued another warning to the Croatian Football Federation following the incident that occurred during their World Cup match against Nigeria on June 16. Croatian fans displayed the banner of The Ustasha -Croatian Revolutionary Movement- during the game at the Kaliningrad Stadium. Federico ADDIECHI, FIFA’s Head of Sustainability & Diversity, ”In this case, where a single banner was held by a single supporter, a warning was issued instead of a fine, because officials from the Croatian Football Federation informed us ourselves, after identifying it,”. “They didn’t want to hide anything from us, and that is why that sanction was chosen.” Earlier, FIFA warned central defender Domagoj Vida who chanted political slogans after the national team’s win over Russia in the quarterfinal, while Ognjen Vukojevic, who scouted the Nigeria squad before the World Cup, was fined. Croatia will face France in the final of the World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium on July 15.(TASS News Agency).
