By Raji Rasak  Lagos   –      A former Nigerian Ambassador, Prof. Michael Omolewa, on Sunday urged the Federal Government to focus on search for peace in its diplomatic relations arrangement. Omolewa, who also was the Permanent delegate to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. The ambassador said that for 10 years (from 2000 to 2009) he represented Nigeria in UNESCO, the country sought for peace, but at the end could still not find it. “Nigeria wants to protect the interest of Africa; we want to protect the interest of the black race and interest of the entire world; we can only do this, if there is peace. “So, the new diplomatic arrangement must be geared toward the search for peace; it is only when there is peace that there can be progress, development, harmony, integration and encouragement of one another. “When we were looking for the integration of all countries in Africa, Nigeria decided to focus its attention in Africa so, they helped South Africa, Angola and Mozambique to be liberated. “But unfortunately, when they became independent, they started antagonising Nigeria. “So, Nigeria decided that it is better to have peace with friends and seek a deliberate policy that will cultivate friendship with those from outside,” he said. Omolewa urged the Federal Government to make Nigerians first, like U.S. in everything, saying that government should protect interest of its citizens. “We should make Nigeria like U.S, which is Nigerians first, then ECOWAS being our neighboring countries second. It is important to live with our neighbours in peace,” he said
