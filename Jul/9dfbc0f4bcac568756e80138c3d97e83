By Nathan Nwakamma Yenagoa –   Chief Richard Kpodo, a former Security Adviser to the former governor of Bayelsa, Timipre Sylva, was on Friday docked before a Magistrates’ Court in Yenagoa, for alleged rape. The accused was charged with unlawfully detaining one Teke Blessing on June 20 at Etegwe, Yenagoa,with an intention to defile her. He was also charged with raping the said Blessing on the same day. However, the accused pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge. His counsel, Funilaifa Seibokuro, urged the court to grant the accused bail, which was opposed by the prosecuting counsel, Ayibatonye Jumbo. Seibokuro said that the offence for which Kpodo was arraigned was a bailable one, and assured that his client, a well-known politician, would be available to face trial. He also said that Kpodo had medical challenges and pleaded that he should be granted bail on self recognition. The prosecuting counsel, in opposing, said that if granted bail, the accused would interfere and influence the prosecution witness and, hence, jeopardise his trial. He also faulted the claim by the defence counsel that the accused had medical challenge as there was no medical report to support it. The court, presided over by Mrs E.T.M. Ere, adjourned the case until Aug. 10. for ruling on the bail application and ordered that the accused to be remanded in prison custody.  (NAN)
