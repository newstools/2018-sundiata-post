By Rita Iliya  Minna   –      Hajiya Ramatu Umaru, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Niger state, has advised residents of the state to engage in tree-planting to protect the environment against flooding and other natural hazards. Umaru gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Minna. She said that tree-planting would help to reduce the impact of erosion on the environment during heavy downpour. She disclosed that the ministry was collaborating with the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) to educate especially rural communities around riverside areas to plant trees to reduce soil erosion. “The state ministry of environment is promoting tree-planting to reduce the impact of flooding especially in areas prone to flood. “We are encouraging our people to plant both economic and other trees to check hazards associated with absence of trees,” Umaru said. She warned against felling of trees for economic purpose, saying that such act exposed the environment to hazards. The permanent secretary advised people of the state to embrace environmental hygiene and stop dumping of refuse indiscriminately in drainages and waterways. “We are appealing to our people to desist from harmful environmental practices such as bush burning, deforestation and to always keep the environment clean where water will flow freely. “We are also advocating for reduction in the use of plastic bags and disposing them indiscriminately,” she said. She called for the support of traditional rulers in sensitising their subjects on the benefits of tree-planting and environmental hygiene.
