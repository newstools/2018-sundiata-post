By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu –  Some football lovers in Enugu, on Saturday, said that the winner of the final of the World Cup would be determined by tactical prowess and soundness, and the match could go either way. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the World Cup final match between France and Croatia will be played on Sunday at the Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow in Russia. Soccer lovers told NAN that it was difficult to decide or give the match to any of the two teams, as both had shown resilience throughout the world football fiesta. An ardent supporter of Rangers International FC, Enugu, Ifeanyi Okonkwo, told NAN :“Both teams are good and they are hard fighters. “However, technical and tactical discipline will help to separate the boys from the men on Sunday, as you know that World Cup is usually won by the more matured, experienced and disciplined side.” Another football enthusiast, Obinna Offor, said he had been following the teams from the group stages and noticed that they were both good in the defence. “It is difficult to place a bet on the game, as both teams are good in their standing. “However, I see a single goal victory on Sunday; which means we are going to see clinical defending once one of the two teams hits the net first,’’Offor, who lives in Ogui Road, said. Contributing, Ebere Amaraizu, a Director with National Nationwide League One (NLO), said:“While France is having a compact and complete team, Croatia is having a dogged team”. Amaraizu said that the match would be explosive and tension-packed as the teams would definitely fight till the final whistle of the game. “The tactical prowess of the coaches will impact much in the match tomorrow (on Sunday) and will be the determining factor for the winner,’’ Amaraizu, who is also the Team Manager of Crime Busters FC, Enugu, said.
