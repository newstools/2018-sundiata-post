By Modupe Oremule  Lago   –      With less than 10 days to the beginning of the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) Championships, Rilwan Alonwonle, a 400m hurdles Commonwealth Games finalist, says he is set make a mark. Alonwonle, 24, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lagos that he hoped to execute each race well at the competition scheduled to hold from Aug. 1 to Aug. 5 in Asaba. “I am excited and I am targeting success. The results will fall in place,’’ he said. NAN reports that the quarter miler returned in the fifth position in the 400m hurdles event at the Commonwealth Games in April. On future plans, he said: “I don’t like to focus too much on the future, because by so doing, it is easy to let current opportunities pass by. “I, however, have future goals in terms of meets I want to compete in, but my main focus at the moment is my next race which will be in Nigeria, in front of a home crowd in Asaba,’’ the athlete said. Alonwonle told NAN that he would his apply experience he garnered at the Commonwealth Games in April to the CAA championships. “Any big time race experience is valuable. Running in the finals helped a lot. “I will still need to bring my best in the coming days by not relying on what I ran in the past,’’ he said. On the achievements of Wayde Van Niekerk of South Africa, he told NAN that it was an indication of abundant talents in Africa. “He is a fantastic athlete in his disciplines. It shows how strong Africans are on track and field,’’ he said. NAN reports that Van Niekerk won gold medal in the 400m event in the 2016 Rio Olympic Games with a world record time of 43.03 seconds (reaction time 0.181 s). He was 24 years. He beat the record time of 43.18 seconds set by Michael Johnson during the 1999 World Athletics Championships in Seville, Spain. South Africa won the last edition of the CAA Championships two years ago in Durban, Kenya placed second, while Nigeria clinched the third position.
