By Ebere Agozie   Abuja   –      Malam Mohammed Bello, the Minister, Federal Capital Territory, says the Federal Government intervention projects will reduce the dangers associated with erosion and floods across the country. Bello said this at the inauguration and handover ceremony of the erosion and flood control intervention works at Abaji and Karshi both in Abuja Municipal Council Area on Friday. He said that the projects were part of those of the third quarter of 2017 awarded by the Federal Government’s Ecological Intervention of the Ecological Fund Office Tenders Board of Oct. 6, 2017. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the intervention projects were executed by the Ecological Funds Office (EFO), office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation. Bello expressed optimism that the intervention would reduce the dangers associated with erosion and persistent flooding to lives and property of people living in the affected areas. “It will also check the menace of flooding and gully erosion in the country, improve the living standard of the people, as well as sustain the environment. “The age-long problem of erosion and flooding in this part of the country cannot be over-emphasised, therefore these projects will bring huge relief to the communities that suffered ecological challenges,’’ he said. Dr Habiba Lawal, the Permanent Secretary, EFO said that the inauguration would achieve the dual purpose of enabling the host community takeover, exercise ownership of the projects and ensure its maintenance and sustainability. “The resources, which the Federal Government has committed to these projects, must not be allowed to go to waste,” she said. She said that the timely completion of the projects was made possible through the efforts of the project contractors, who worked tirelessly to ensure minimum loss of time.
