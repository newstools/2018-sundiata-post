By Kadiri Abdulrahman  Lagos   –     The National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) has advised Nigerian graduates residing abroad to use personal digital scanner for thumbprint to enable them complete online registration for the forthcoming 2018 batch”B” orientation.
Muhammed Momoh, NYSC Lagos State Coordinator, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos.
Momoh added that the foreign based graduates could also defer the thumbprint part of the registration until their arrival in Nigeria ahead of the orientation. “For the foreign based graduates who find it difficult to apend their thumbprint to their registration in our portal, it is adviseable for them to get a personal digital scanner to be able to do that.
“In the alternative, a window is open for them to come home one week after the registration portal closes to be able to upload their thumbprint.
“The registration portal will be closed one week before orientation commences” he said.
NAN reports that the NYSC registration portal opened on July 10 and will close on July 16 while the orientation camp will open on Tuesday, July 24.
Some foreign based students had earlier reported difficulty in uploading their thumbprints on the NYSC portal which was a major requirement for the online registrationl for mobilisation.
