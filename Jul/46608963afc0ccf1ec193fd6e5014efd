By Deborah Akpede  Ikeja   –       A 27 -year-old unemployed man, Lukmon Ahmed, was on Friday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly burgling an apartment to steal valuables worth N48,000. Ahmed, who resides at Ajagbandi, Alaba, a Lagos suburb, however, pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of stealing and burglary brought against him. He was, however, released on bail in the sum of N100, 000 with two sureties in like sum. The Magistrate, Mrs F.F George, who gave the ruling, said the sureties should be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. According to the Police Prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Awase, the accused committed the offence on June 5 at Orisunbare, Ayobo, a suburb of Lagos. Awase said the accused broke into the residence of the complainant, Mr Sesan Erinfolami, to steal some valuables. He listed the stolen items as two watches valued at N10, 000, gold necklace worth N20, 000 and cash of N18, 000, totalling N48, 000. Awase said the complainant came home and saw the accused scaling his fence into the next compound. “When the accused discovered that the owner had come back, he scaled the fence to escape but the complainant sighted him and shouted “thief, thief”. “It was the occupants of the next house who apprehended him while the stolen items were recovered from him and immediately handed him over to the police,’’ the prosecutor said. The offences contravened Sections 287 and 308 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 attracts three years jail term for stealing, while Section 308 stipulates five years imprisonment for burglary. The case was adjourned until Aug. 1 for mention.
