By Oluwatope Lawanson Lagos –   An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court has sentenced two brothers, Moses Sunday and Godwin Sunday, to one month community service for unlawful possession of a toy gun. Chief Magistrate Olufunke Sule-Amzat, sentenced the siblings after they pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of conspiracy and unlawful possession of a toy gun. She directed that the convicts should spend two hours everyday for the next one month carrying out community service. According to Sule-Amzat, the sentence will serve as a deterrent to others, who are planning to commit such crime. The duo urged the court to temper justice with mercy, saying it was done out of ignorance and poverty. Earlier, Police Prosecutor Benson Emuerhi told the court that the accused committed the offences on June 27 at 11.30 p.m. in Mushin
area of Lagos. Emuerhi said that the accused conspired with others still at large to commit the offences. “The defendants were apprehended by the Police from Alakara Division during a stop-and-search operation. “They could not give a satisfactory explanation of the ownership of the toy gun and other dangerous weapons in their
possession,’’ he said. The prosecutor said that the police patrol team had stopped the defendants and their other accomplices, who are now at large. “The weapons were found on them were allegedly used to cause terror or fear in the community.” The offences contravened Sections 330 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos state, 2015 (Revised).
