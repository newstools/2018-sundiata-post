By Uwumarogie Peter Gombe –  Malam Jamil Gwamna, the Sardauna Gombe, says Alhaji Abubakar Hashidu, the first elected governor of Gombe State was an emblem of peace. Gwamna told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in a telephone interview on Saturday in Gombe, that the late governor was a unifying factor in the state. He said that his fatherly role of promoting peaceful co-existence in Gombe State would be greatly missed. According to him, the late governor’s conceding of defeat in 2003, was an indication that he was an emblem of peace. “The late governor was a man of peace for those of us who knew him, he insists on peaceful co-existence amongst his people at all times. “He would never promote any cause that would jeopardise the peace of the state. “At every forum, he emphasises the need to shun violence and play politics by its rules. “He sees peace as the strongest tool for developing any society and for this, the late governor would always be remembered for his role in ensuring that the state stays united. “As an incumbent who lost an election, yet, he applauded the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), which shows how committed he was to promote peace,’’ he said. The Sardauna urged all political leaders to emulate the late governor’s, and work for peaceful 2019 general elections. Hashidu died on July 27, in his Gombe residence at the age of 74. He was elected the first executive governor of Gombe State in May 1999.  (NAN)
