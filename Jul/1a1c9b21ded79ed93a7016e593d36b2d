By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Siundiata Post) – Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose has hailed the Minister of Labour and Productivity, Senator Chris Ngige for his boldness to campaign for him in the presence of his dreaded boss, President Muhammadu Buhari. Describing Ngige as a man who is not always afraid to say the truth, Fayose said that the minister demonstrated this rare trait when it matters most- at the rally organised by the All Progressives Congress. Fayose thanked the minister when he took to his twitter handle @GovAyoFayose thus: “I thank my good friend, Dr. Chris Ngige for campaigning for me at the APC rally in Ado Ekiti yesterday. Dr. Ngige is a man who is not always afraid to say the truth and that’s what he demonstrated yesterday even in the presence of the President and other APC leaders”. Sundiata Post recall that the former governor of Anambra state had on Tuesday in Ado Ekiti at the All Progressives Congress rally attended by President Muhammadu Buhari, national chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and other stalwarts of the party, asked Ekiti people to use their Permanent Voters Crads (PVC) to vote Ayodele Fayose instead of Kayode Fayemi of his party. Senator Ngige erroneously mentioned Fayose’s name twice before he was corrected by the crowd at the rally which chorused Fayemi. While Kayode Fayemi is the flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti state, Ayodele Fayose is the out-going Governor in the state but of the People Democratic Party extraction.
