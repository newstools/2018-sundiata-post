By Chimezie Anaso  Awka,  –     Mr Joachim Ulasi, Director, National Population Commission (NPC) in Anambra, has said lifestyle and culture of a people were major determinants of their quality of life.
Ulasi said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka on Thursday.
He described the quality of life of a family in Anambra as not worrisome, compared with what was obtainable in some other states.
The Director, who said the average family size in the state range between six and eight, attributed it to the monogamous system of marriage which is dominant in the state.
He said inspite of that, some families in the state still had problems maintaining a good quality of life and recommended that couples should seek family planning as a right.
Ulasi said national development would be faster if the family, which is the unit of any society is sustainable.
Speaking on the theme of this year’s World Population Day (WPD), “Family Planning is a Human Right”, Ulasi said no member of a family should be denied quality life.
“This year we are talking about the right to family planning, couples must access family planning not as a privilege but as a right.
“Though in Anambra we are not doing badly, the size of an average family here is between four and eight.
“But we are looking at the quality of life in the family and not the size, however, the size of the family has much to contribute to its quality.
“Naturally, family sizes in places where monogamy is practiced will be less than where you have polygamy and that is what is responsible for encouraging quality of life in Anambra here,” he said.
Ulasi said the commission would intensify awareness for family planning in the state through media advocacy.
He called on government agencies, churches and other social organisations to help make the service available and accessible.
