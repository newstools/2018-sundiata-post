By Moronke Boboye  Lagos   –     An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday remanded a 30-year-old unemployed man, Ismaila Babalola, in Kirikiri Prisons after pleading guilty to stealing a generator set valued at N56,000. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Jadesola Adeyemi-Ajayi, ordered the remand of the accused after he admitted committing the crime. Adeyemi-Ajayi, however, adjourned the case until July 24 for sentencing. The accused, whose address was not given, is being tried for entering a building with intent to steal. The prosecutor, Insp. Raji Akeem, had earlier told the court that the offence was committed on July 1 at 14, Araromi St., Iju, a suburb of Lagos. Akeem said that the accused jumped through the fence of Mr Adeola Ogundipe’s compound and stole his generator valued at N56, 000. “Thereafter, the accused was on his way with the generator when a neighbour, who has been noticing his movements, alerted other tenants. “The accused was apprehended and handed over to the police,’’ the prosecutor said. The offence contravened Sections 287 and 308 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
