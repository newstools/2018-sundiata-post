By Abbas Bamalli  Dandume    –       The Acting Chairman, Dandume Local Government in Katsina State, Alhaji Hassan Musa, says the Council would provide adequate electricity in Dandume town and its environs. Musa made the pledge on Friday while inspecting some damaged and faulty electrical equipment in some parts of the area. The affected areas include: Layin Shehi, Badole, Magaji Wando, Tumburkai, Baraje and Madobi. “In some of these areas we visited, we realised that their electricity Transformers have not been connected to the National Grid for about three years, while some of the areas have been without electricity for over two years now,” he said. He said those without electricity for the past two years suffered as a result of broken poles and damage of other electrical equipment. The acting chairman said the local government would continue to tackle the challenges they were facing, especially in the areas of power supply ,water supply and health care. “It is our priority to focus more on socio-economic growth of our area to provide the people with their basic needs to enable them to carry out their normal activities,” he said. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the acting chairman also visited the Dandume Office of the Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) where he called on the officials to handle issues concerning electricity supply with all seriousness. He also urged them to redouble their efforts toward ensuring adequate and constant power supply in the affected areas. According to him, the visit is to know the kinds of equipment needed for the repairs of the damaged facilities to enable the local government to assist. The Officer in charge of the Unit, Alhaji Ahmad Ahijo, advised the Acting Chairman to formally write to the company for onward submission to its Zonal office for further action.
