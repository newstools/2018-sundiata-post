The event tagged: “the First National Unity Food Fair 2018” is slated to hold from Oct. 15 to Oct. 17. The event, which would hold at the Peace Park of the International Conference Centre, Abuja, would coincide with the World Food Day Celebration. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that World Food Day is celebrated on Oct. 16 every year to highlight the importance of food to humanity and to fight hunger and poverty. Shoda revealed that the 36 States of the federation and FCT as well as private sector players in the food industry will showcase their products and services. She said that relevant ministries and agencies of the Federal Government would equally be part of the fair. Mrs Aisha Buhari, NCWS Grand Patron and wife of the President, will be representing Mr. President to declare this epoch making event open. “This event was conceived to enhance the present administration’s efforts toward food self-sufficiency as well as diversification of the economy. “Some of the objectives of the fair include: promotion of popular Nigeria dishes from various sections of the country, to encourage culinary exchanges among Nigeria ethnic groups for national integration; to educate Nigeria families on balance food and good eating habits. “Others are to identify and empower women with talents for Nigeria cuisine; to use this platform to generate, demand, enhance and increase employment among women.” According to the president of the society, this will boost government’s National Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and to complement government’s efforts in the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)(
