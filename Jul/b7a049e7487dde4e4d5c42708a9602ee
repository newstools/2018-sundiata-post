By Funmilola Gboteku  Lagos   –     Multinational networking and telecommunications company, Ericsson, has announced a new initiative which will see Singapore’s first 5G pilot network go live before the end of 2018. In a statement on Monday, Ericson said that Singtel and it were strengthening their 5G Centre for Excellence Programme partnership to achieve the feat. It said that 5G pilot network would be deployed at one-north in Buona Vista, Singapore’s science, business and information technology hub. Ericsson said that the pilot network would deliver 5G coverage with enhanced mobile broadband speed and low latency communications. The multinational company said that the pilot network would use 3GPP standards-compliant 5G technology with the trial spectrum allocated by Singapore’s Info-Communications Media Development Authority. According to Ericson, transportation, healthcare and manufacturing industries can leverage on 5G to accelerate digital transformation and deploy advanced automation technologies. He said that enterprises could also work with Singtel and Ericsson at one-north to develop new 5G use and tap the business potential of 5G. Mr Mark Chong, Group Chief Technology Officer of Singtel, said in the statement that 5G had the potential to accelerate the digital transformation of industries, as well as empower consumers with innovative applications. Chong said that Singtel and Ericsson would conduct drone trials later in the year at one-north, using the 5G pilot network.
