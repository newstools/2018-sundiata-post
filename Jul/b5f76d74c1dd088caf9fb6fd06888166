By Funmilola Gboteku Lagos –  The Association of Licensed Telecommunications Operators of Nigeria (ALTON) says it will advise MTN Nigeria to consider preventive shutdown of network if its picketing by the organised labour leads to damage to telecoms facilities. The ALTON Chairman, Mr Gbenga Adebayo, said that the shutdown would be necessary to avoid damage to network. Adebayo made this known in a statement in Lagos. He said that damage to telecom facilities would lead to disruption of critical national security and economic services which could expose citizens to danger. “We hereby strongly request government and its law enforcement agencies to intervene expeditiously, otherwise the association will advise its member to consider preventive shutdown,’’ he said. Adebayo said that disruption of operations of MTN through the picketing by the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) would lead to poor quality of services which would affect the country as a whole. “Members of ALTON are law-abiding organisations who are committed to best practices in all areas including labour-related matters. “Employees of our members are able to join or form associations and unions if they so desire. “However, the practice is that membership of associations and unions are voluntary, in line with fundamental human rights regarding freedom of association as guaranteed by the constitution. “Individuals must not be compelled to join an association or union if they do not choose to do so,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NLC picketed MTN Nigeria on Monday and continued on Tuesday over alleged unfair labopir practices. The NLC President, Mr Ayuba Wabba, told journalists during picketing of MTN Headquarters in Lagos that the organised labour would not tolerate deprivation or enslavement of the Nigerian worker. Wabba said that MTN Nigeria refused to adhere to labour rules and allow its workers to belong to unions. MTN, however, denied the allegations.  (NAN)
