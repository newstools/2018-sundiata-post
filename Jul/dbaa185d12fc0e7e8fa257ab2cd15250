By Moses Omorogieva/Mateen Badru  Lagos –  The Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Mr Imohimi Edgal, on Monday said the command had arrested four suspects for kidnapping children in worship centres in the state. Edgal told newsmen at the Police Command, Ikeja, that the suspects were tracked to Port-Harcourt, where they were arrested. He urged religious leaders to be more vigilant in their worship centres as some kidnappers now adopt a new method of operation by  pretending to be worshippers in their bid to abduct children. “Four suspects have been tracked through account details to Port-Harcourt and arrested. We will not keep quiet until we conclude investigation,’’ Edgal said. He said that with the arrest of the four suspects, the police was closing in on arresting other suspects. The police commissioner called on religious leaders to contact the Divisional Police Officers in charge of their areas to provide them with security during worship at weekends and on week days. He said that the police had recorded two cases in two popular churches in Lagos where some hoodlums infiltrated and used their new modus operandi. “In both instances, these hoodlums pose as worshippers, come into children’s department, and when ushers are not vigilant, any kid that strays is stolen. “I am using this opportunity to call on all worship centres to increase security around children during worship. “For every worship session, the DPO must provide two categories of security. Those that will be in uniform for external security and the plain clothed ones for internal security. “It is not enough to just establish worship centres. The welfare and security of the worshippers is your responsibility,’’ he said.  (NAN)
