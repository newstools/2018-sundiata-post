By Yakubu Uba Mubi (Adamawa) –   The newly elected executives of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Adamawa on Monday commenced familiarization tour of 21 local government areas in the state. The party’s State Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi, who disclosed this to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said the tour would give the newly elected executive members the opportunity to meet and mobilize the party members at the grassroots. He said the tour which started with Mubi North and other local government areas in the northern part of the state would promote unity in the party ahead of the 2019 elections. “Basically, what we hope to achieve by this tour is to know each other in APC better. “By the end of this tour, APC will be more united and fully ready for the 2019 general elections,” Abdullahi said. He lauded the performance of APC-led government in the state, adding that the performance would contribute a lot in facilitating the victory of the party candidates at all levels in the state. He also lauded the restoration of peace and civil authority in northern part of the state affected by insurgency, adding that the people of Adamawa would continue to remain grateful to Buhari administration for that feat. “Today we are starting our tour in northern part of the state hitherto a no go area because of the insurgency. “Even for this security achievement alone, Adamawa people will continue to remain grateful to APC government under President Buhari and will work for his return in 2019,” Abdullahi said.
