By Toba Ajayi  Ilorin   –      Mr Godwin Oyekanmi, a school proprietor, has called on government at all levels to close down “special centers’’ used for examination malpractices in the country. Oyekanmi, who is the proprietor of Bright Future Nursery & Primary School, Agbo-Oba, Ilorin, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Tuesday. He said that such special centers also known as “miracle centre’’ had become legal examination centers in the country but were being used for illegal practices.. He said that parents were fond of registering their children in such centers to write their Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) just to ensure they succeeded at all cost. According to him, special center has become a home of examination malpractices because it is guaranteed when the candidate pay extra money. “Every corner in the country has now become special examination center. You will see parents rushing to register their children not minding the cost and the consequence. “Miracle centers have now become a legal business for some owners of coaching centers. They will assure the students of success and convince them to register with them. Even during the JAMB and SSCE it happens. “These numerous special centers are gradually killing the educational system in the country and it is encouraging laziness among the students. “It is time for government to say no to miracle centers; time for government to be strict and rigid in its approach toward the act. “Government must put the so called special centers under security watch. Arrest whoever is found in the act and sentenced to prison in order to curb the menace,” he said. The proprietor, however, advised parents to encourage their children to read and stop misleading them to shortcuts to success through cheating and malpractices.
