By Moses Omorogieva Lagos –  No fewer than 20 suspected hoodlums terrorising residents of Ketu, Mile 12. in Kosofe area of Lagos State had been arrested after a raid of the area by operatives of Ketu Police Division. The Spokesman for the Police in Lagos, CSP Chike Oti, who confirmed the arrests, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday that the suspects would be charged to court. He said the suspects had been attacking residents of Ketu and snatching bags from people, particularly women at night and early morning. NAN reports that some of the hoodlums had no residential address, while some claimed to be load carriers in Ketu and Mile 12. Oti said their arrest and arraignment would bring some peace to the people in Ketu and commuters at the bus stops, where they operated most times.  (NAN)
