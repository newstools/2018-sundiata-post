By Abiodun Esan Ilorin –   Kwara State Governor, Abdulfatah Ahmed on Tuesday took the long awaited decision to switch from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The defection of the Governor was relayed in a terse statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant (SSA), on Media and Communication, Dr Muyideen Akorede in Ilorin on Tuesday. It was timed to coincide with a similar declaration by his mentor, the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, who announced on Twitter his exit from the APC. “Following due consultations with the people and in response to calls by major stakeholder groups in the state, Kwara State Governor, Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed today defected to the People’s Democratic Party(PDP),” the statement said. According to the statement, Gov Ahmed declared that APC can no longer serve as a platform for achieving the aspirations and expectations of his people. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that the Governor held a meeting with APC stakeholders last week Thursday where the people prevailed on him to lead them to the PDP. Ahmed is the second APC governor to join the PDP, following Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state. Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal is expected to join them.  (NAN)
