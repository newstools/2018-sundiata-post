By Ihechinyere Chigemeri-Uwom Umuahia –   Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has underscored the need for Nigerians to elect leaders with capacity to tackle the nation’s economic and security challenges in 2019. Abubakar said this on Friday when he visited Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia in Umuahia. He said: “We have the issue of insecurity. You are not secure wherever you may be in the North, South, East or West. “In every aspect of our economic endeavour, we have gone back. All these are serious security and economic issues. “Therefore, it has become imperative for us to put our heads together, unite and make sure we elect leaders that can reverse all these.” Abubakar commended Abia government for its efforts at addressing the infrastructure deficit in the state and the commitment toward upgrading Aba to a world-class industrial and commercial city. Responding, Ikpeazu said that it was necessary for Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) faithful to strategise and make good decision on who should become the party’s presidential candidate in the 2019 polls. He said that such decision “should reflect the interest of Nigerians,” adding that the unity of the country was central to its economic growth. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the former vice president also visited PDP Secretariat in Umuahia, where he held a closed-door meeting with the leadership and major stakeholders of the party. He also addressed party members and supporters at the Michael Okpara Auditorium, where he urged them to remain steadfast in their support for the party. Abubakar said he was in the state to formally inform the party and its members about his presidential aspiration ahead of the party’s national convention.  (NAN)
