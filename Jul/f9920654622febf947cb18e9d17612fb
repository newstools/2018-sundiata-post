By Abiemwense Moru Abuja – A member of the House of Representatives, Rep. Omosede Igbinedion (Edo-PDP), has called for more active participation and representation of youths in Nigeria’s politics to give Nigeria a brighter future. Igbinedion made the call on Wednesday when a delegation of an NGO, the Centre for Ethics and Self Value Orientation, paid her a courtesy visit in Abuja. The lawmaker, while thanking the group for the initiative, lauded the successes recorded by youths in other areas like sports, entertainment, among other spheres. According to her, this is sign of competence in their endeavours and that will not exempt politics. “If youths have excelled in such spheres of life, they can do same in politics as well, if they have the right perception. “All that youths need is to commit themselves with the right concept and ideology, believe in themselves that nothing is impossible and then things will turn around,’’ Igbinedion said. She said it was sad to note that many youths in Nigeria had nonchalant attitude toward politics. The lawmaker, who represents Ovia South West- Ovia North-East Federal Constituency of Edo, also decried the level of poverty in the country. Igbinedion called for urgent need to address the high level of poverty. The lawmaker, who sympathised with Nigerians over the incessant killings in the country, said that the Peoples Democratic Party would right all the wrongs comes 2019.
Earlier, Mr Saleh Musa, the Executive Director, Centre for Ethics and Self Value Orientation, presented her with the award of excellence. Musa said that the award was in recognition of her outstanding performance as a Federal lawmaker.  (NAN)
