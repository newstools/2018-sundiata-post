By Deborah Coker Benin –   The Benin Zonal Command of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) on Monday joined the United Nations (UN) to mark the World Day Against Human Trafficking with a five-kilometre walk round major roads in Benin. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the road walk was led by Mr Nduka Nwanwenne, the Zonal Commander of NAPTIP in charge of Edo and Delta. NAN also reports that sister agencies, as well as Non-Governmental Organisations, participated in the road walk which commenced from the Adesuwa Road office of the agency and ended at the Press Centre of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ). Nwanwenne said that July 30 every year was set aside by the UN to draw attention to the ills inherent in trafficking in persons. He said that NAPTIP had recorded huge successes in the fight against human trafficking over the years and would not relent until the menace was tackled. Nwanwenne noted that in spite of the successes recorded, some challenges still abound, which included indulgence of wards by their parents who goad them into travelling abroad. The NAPTIP official warned that any parent caught conniving with traffickers would be prosecuted. He also urged victims to come out and testify, assuring them that NAPTIP would offer protection. Nwanwenne said that the command had over the years rescued more than 3,000 trafficked persons while no fewer than 500 had been rescued since January. He stressed the need for all stakeholders to partner to fight the scourge, adding that NAPTIP alone could not do it. ” The way forward for us is the constructive engagement of the whole society and government in the fight against human trafficking,’’ he said.
