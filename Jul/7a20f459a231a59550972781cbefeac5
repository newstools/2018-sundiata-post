The Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Saddique Abubakar, disclosed this when he visited the NAF 207 Quick Response Group Headquarters in Gusau on Wednesday. Abubakar said he was in Zamfara primarily to understand what the force was doing in terms of supporting the Defence Headquarters in fighting insecurity in the state. He said the efforts of the air force was being augmented with the special forces from the Nigerian Army and other sister security agencies. “I want to know efforts so far put in place and the areas that needed more intervention. “Part of the aim of the visit is to deploy more helicopters and fighter aircraft to Zamfara to fight the criminals that have been terrorising the state. “Because there is no airport here in Gusau, we will be operating from Katsina to Zamfara and other areas to ensure that we bring to an end the activities of these criminals,” Abubakar said.
