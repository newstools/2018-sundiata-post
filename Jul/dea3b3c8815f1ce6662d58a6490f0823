By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja –  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised the people of Ekiti state to vote for its governorship candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola-Eleka and protect their votes in Saturday’s election in the state. The PDP made the call in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan on Thursday in Abuja. The party said that the harassment, arrests, threats and Wednesday’s manhandling of Gov. Ayo Fayose by the police amplified the need for Ekiti people to vote en masse for the PDP on Saturday. “We know that the whole essence of heavy security presence in Ekiti state is to attempt to frighten the people and scare them away from participating in the election. “We are sure that such cannot work in Ekiti where the people are famous for their boldness, fearlessness and resistance in the face of repression. “The PDP therefore charges the people of Ekiti state to use the election to manifest to the world, their well-known bravery, by coming out in their millions in defiance of all odds to vote for their preferred candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola-Eleka. “The PDP urges the people to fully exert their resilience by being alert and using every energy available in a democracy to resist any act of rigging and ensure that they protect their votes until the very end,” Ologbondiyan said. The party also cautioned officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agencies and election observers participating in the election to note the trend in Ekiti. The party said that any action contrary to set rules would attract terrible consequences directly from the people. “This is so because Ekiti is a known stronghold of the PDP and we shall never allow anybody, by whatever means, to manipulate us out in this election. “We stand with the Ekiti people in their quest for one man, one vote,” he said.
