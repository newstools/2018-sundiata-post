Ademola, 51, whose residential address was not given, is standing trial on a two-count charge bordering on fraud and issuance of dud cheque. The Prosecutor, Insp.

He said that the accused fraudulently obtained the sum of N10.5 million belonging to Edge Leasing Solutions Ltd. and failed to repay the money. Emby said that the accused issued two different First bank cheques of N1.2 million and N9.3 million respectively but the cheques were dishonoured on presentation due to insufficient funds. The offences contravened Sections 321 (b) and 287 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge. In his ruling, the Magistrate, Mr A. A. Adefulire, granted N500,000 bail to the accused with two sureties in like sum. Adefulire said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and must show evidence of identification.
