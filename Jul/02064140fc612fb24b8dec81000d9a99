By Yemi Adeleye  Lagos,   –     A Chieftain of the National Youth Council of Nigeria, (NYCN) Mr Innocent Nduanya has urged President Muhammadu Buhari, to interact more with the youth as 2019 elections approaches. According to him, regular interaction will make the youth to fully understand the achievements of the present administration.
Nduanya, a former Deputy President of the council, who is contesting as its president, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN) in Lagos.
NAN reports that the NYCN national election is billed for July 19th. Nduanya spoke to NAN after a meeting organised by the South-West zone of the NYCN, where his campaign team came to the zone to canvass and solicit support for his aspiration as the next President of the NYCN. “There is need for closer relationship between the President and the youth of this nation. He needs to get in touch with the youth and always have interactive sessions with them.”
“This will help create better understanding from the misinformation the youths are exposed to especially via the social media platforms,’’ he said. On the reason for contesting the NYCN top position, Nduanya said that his intention was to reposition the council by engaging the Nigerian youth to contribute meaningfully to nation building. He said that his first priority, if given the opportunity to serve, would be to open opportunities for youths and engage the Federal Government to ensure further youth empowerment.
“One of the things we will do when we get in is to make sure we engage the youths and make them part of the government. “We will also pressurise various political parties to give youths ticket to run in the forthcoming election. If I emerge as the next president, we are going to hold a Nigerian Youths Political Summit,” he said.
The aspirant, who vowed not to ‘sell’ NYCN to any politician, said that the council would only support politicians that were ready to advance the cause of the youth.
