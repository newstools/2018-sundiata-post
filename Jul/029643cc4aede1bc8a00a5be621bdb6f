By Hamza Suleiman Maiduguri –   The Police Command in Borno said it had closed its Motor Traffic Division (MTD) over allegation of extortion and illegal detention of tricycle operators by its personnel. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Damian Chukwu, who disclosed this to journalists in Maiduguri on Monday, said the division would remain closed pending investigation by the command headquarters. Chukwu said that the tricycle operators had alleged that some police traffic officers were extorting them. He said they also protested that some government officials were placing high levies on them. “We have closed our traffic division and the erring officers would be made to face the disciplinary committee. “Those found wanting would be punished,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Tricycle operators under the auspices of Association of Tricycle Riders Transport Union in the state, had embarked on a protest against the illegal acts blocking major roads in Maiduguri.
