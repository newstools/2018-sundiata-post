By Ibrahim Ahmad Gusau –  The National Youth Chambers Council of Nigeria (NYCCN), Zamfara State Chapter, has pledged to remain committed to the fight against drug abuse in the state.
The State Coordinator, Jamilu Iliyasu, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in an interview in Gusau on Monday.
Iliyasu said it was one of the objectives of the organisation, to work towards eliminating social vices among youths especially women.
He said the organisation was collaborating with government, private sector, development partners, community and religious leaders as well as other civil society organisations in the campaign against drug abuse.
He said the illegal consumption of codeine syrup and other toxic substances among young persons was worrisome.
He explained that a large number of people had become mentally unstable, which had also increased security in the state.
He said the organisation was raising awareness by sensitising the public to the dangers of drug abuse.
“We have seen the importance of establishing drug clubs in secondary schools, to enable our campaign cover all local government areas in the state.  (NAN)
