By Bridget Ikyado Makurdi –   The Benue State Government says it plans to take legal action against owners of illegal structures within Makurdi metropolis.
Mr Saint Gbilekaa, the newly appointed General Manager of the state Urban Development Board, stated this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), shortly after assuming office on Tuesday in Makurdi.
Gbilekaa took over from Mr Richard Agwa, who was sacked by Gov. Mr Samuel Ortom on July 9, for poor performance.
He said the existence of illegal structures remained a great challenge to the board, saying that punitive measures would be introduced to address the problem.
Gbilekaa said the board would look into the master plan of the state and any structure wrongly sited without due approved would be demolished.
He explained that inorder to make urban areas conducive, illegal structures and buildings without approval must not be allowed to stand.
According to him, such structures or buildings will be demolished after serving owners abatement notice to vacate the area.
“Many factors could lead to the growth of legal structures in the metropolis, for example some areas are not meant for shopping activities.
“We also have the problem of individuals building filling stations in residential areas, which happen after the land is acquired for residential purpose, but after approval the land is turned to a commercial structure.
“Since such owners do not have permit to develop such structures, they are regarded as illegal, a good reason why we will demolish them,” Gbilekaa said.
The general manager warned of the staff of board to shun sharp practices and adhere to best practices, just as he also promised to look into issues of their welfare.  (NAN)
