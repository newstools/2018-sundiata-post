By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  High Court sitting in Imo State has suspended  the swearing-in of Mr.  Calistus Ekenze as the new Deputy Governor of the state. The court order came as the Attorney General of the state, Miletus Nlemadim, was about administering oath of office on Ekenze on Tuesday morning. Recall that the former Deputy Governor, Eze Madumere was on Monday impeached by the Imo State House of Assembly in a controversial circumstance. The court had first ruled that the panel set up regarding the impeachment process should suspend further action. Madumere then returned to court seeking an order to overturn his impeachment. In a fresh interim order, the court put the swearing-in ceremony on hold pending its final ruling. The Attorney General informed the gathering that the state would obey the order but would file an application seeking vacation of the order in coming days. Sundiata Post recalls that on July 10, the Imo State Assembly commenced impeachment proceedings against Madumere for allegedly abandoning his duties for a long time and refusing to carry out official duties assigned to him by the governor. Earlier, the Speaker, Acho Ihim, has suspended a lawmaker who kicked against the impeachment process. This is also as the house had suspended the pro-Madumere lawmakers who are in the minority.  Madumere emerged Deputy Governor following the impeachment of Mr Jude Agabso for his refusal to dump the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) the platform they rode through to become to power.
