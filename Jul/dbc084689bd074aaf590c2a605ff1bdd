By Ibrahim Kado  Gombe   –     A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Gombe on Monday remanded a 30-year-old conductor, Habu Munkaila, in prison over alleged raping of a 10-year-old girl. Munkaila, who resides at Dukkuyel Village in Dukku Local Government Area of Gombe State, is facing a charge of raping a minor. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Babayo Usamatu, remanded the accused after he pleaded guilty to the charge. Usamatu adjourned the case until Sept. 4. The prosecutor, Sgt. Bako Shekari, told the court that on June 25 the accused took the girl to a bush with the intention of having sexual intercourse with her. Shekari said that the girl raised an alarm, which attracted neighbours, who prevented the accused from completing the act. He said that the offence was contrary to Section 409 of the Penal Code Law. Shekari, however, urged the court to adjourn the case to enable the police to complete its investigation.
