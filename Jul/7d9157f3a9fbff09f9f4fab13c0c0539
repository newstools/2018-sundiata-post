He said, “The future of humanity and of our planet lies in our hands and in the hands of today’s generation who will pass the torch to future generations. “I call on young people to fulfil their roles of uniting diverse groups of young people to fight for the same goal and see the attainment of the SDGs as long term achievement. “Young people are communicators, therefore, they can be partners in communicating the 2030 agenda to their peers and communities. ’’  (NAN)
