By Gabriel Idowu Ado-Ekiti –  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Saturday urged Nigerians to ignore the purported Ekiti governorship election results making the rounds on the social media. The Ekiti Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. AbdulGaniyu Raji, made the plea in Ado-Ekiti. “Our attention has been drawn to illegal release of results of the 2018 governorship election in Ekiti State on the social media. ” Consequently, we wish to inform the general public that the Ekiti state governorship election is still ongoing. “Counting of ballots is still in progress, collation of results is equally going on in some areas. ” All the floating news in the social media in respect of the results of the election should be discountenanced by the public. “The announcement of the election result would be made by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) at the appropriate time,” Raji said in the statement.
