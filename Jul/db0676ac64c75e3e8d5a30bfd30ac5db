By Taiye Baiyerohi   Lagos   –       Yeni Kuti, the daughter of late legendary musician, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, has urged Nigerians to take pride in their cultures saying President Emmanuel Macron of France’s visit has revealed how Nigerian cultures are highly rated within the international community. Kuti told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the Nigerian cultural values which most Nigerians did not value were better appreciated in foreign countries as demonstrated by the visit of Macron last week to the Afrikan Shrine in Lagos. She said that the visit was a great development and an added value to the history of the nation. According to her, this must signal to Nigerians that they must embrace their cultures in order to develop them to further attract tourists to the nation. “For the President of a nation like France to have visited the Afrikan Shrine, it means that Nigeria can be tourists’ most preferred destination.’’ She said that it was unfortunate that most Nigerians did not appreciate and value their cultures and traditions as much as was done by foreigners. “We must all wake-up to better appreciate our cultures which are capable of projecting us better in the comity of nations.’’ Kuti commended the Lagos State Government (LASG) for the initiative saying it would improve patronage to the Afrikan Shrine, the Kalakuta Museum and the annual Felabration Festival. She said that having reputable world leaders such as Macron to have visited the Afrikan Shrine in Lagos would boost the nation’s tourism industry, other state governors should emulate this.
