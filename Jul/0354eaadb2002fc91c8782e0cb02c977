By George Odok Calabar –  The Cross River chapter on the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) has raised an alarm over the increasing rate medical quackery in the state. Dr Effiong Mkpanam, NMA Chairman in the state, made this known on Thursday in Calabar during the 2018 Annual General Meeting/Scientific Conference of the association. NAN reports that the theme of the conference is “Impact of Economic and Security Challenges on Nigeria’s Health Sector”. Mkpanam said that medical quackery in Cross River was assuming an embarrassing dimension, hence the need to curb the menace. He said that the NMA had invested in anti-quackery measures with a view to fighting the menace. According to him, medical doctors now use the ‘Doctor’s Stamp’, which took effect in 2015,
as a way to curb quackery in the health sector. “Quackery in Cross River is assuming another embarrassing dimension. “Henceforth, all reports from doctors must carry this customized stamp which carries the doctor’s name, institution attended, the medical registration and folio number. “This stamp has been approved by government and is widely accepted.” He urged Gov. Ben Ayade to employ more consultants, nurses and medical officers into the state health sector and also upgrade health facilities across the state. The Keynote Speaker, Prof. Rowland Ndoma-Egba, who spoke on the conference theme, said urged governments at all levels to invest massively in the health sector. Ndoma-Egba, a former Chief Medical Director, University of Calabar Teaching Hospital,
noted that infrastructure in hospitals was relatively low. “A situation where power does not exist, consultants not taken, no training of medical personnel, no equipment and salaries, would jeopardise healthcare delivery.” Also, Mr Godwin Iyala, the Special Adviser on Health Insurance to Gov. Ayade, said that the insurance agency was collaborating with the NMA to deliver quality health service to residents of the state.  (NAN)
