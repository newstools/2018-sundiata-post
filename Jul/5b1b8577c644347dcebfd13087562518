By Henry Oladele Lagos –  Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Sanni Liman on Tuesday formally took over as the Commandant, Nigerian Armed Forces Resettlement Centre, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. AVM Agustine Jekenu handed over to Liman at a brief ceremony held at the centre in Oshodi, Lagos. Jekenu thanked President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, for the opportunity given to him to serve. “I had an interesting time working with the staff and officers of the centre. “I give God the glory for the peaceful environment during my stay. I enjoin everyone to cooperate with the new commandant,” he said. Jekennu said serving at NAFRC was worth the while, adding that he felt fulfilled to have added value to the institution. “I have been in NAFRC for 18 months. I am glad that I am handing over to AVM Liman a work force and environment that is much better than what I met. “AVM Liman has no fears at all because the workforce he is inheriting is a very motivated one,” he said. Earlier, the new commandant said he would do everything in his powers to improve on what his predecessor did. Acknowledging the transformation of the centre within the 18 month Jekennu held sway, Liman appealed to the directing staff of NAFRC to accord him similar support to sustain the tempo. “AVM Jekennu has achieved a lot within the period he served here. I will say he has left a size 17 shoe for me to feel. “Although he is retired, he is not tired and so, he should know that we will also come to him for advice, suggestions and tips. He has now become a consultant. “To the directing staff, we will also need to work as a team because it is a collective responsibility. “If NAFRC fails or succeeds today, it is all of us that have failed or succeeded not just the commandant,” he said.
