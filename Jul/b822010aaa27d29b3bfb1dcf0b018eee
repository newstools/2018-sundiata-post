By Abiemwense Moru Abuja –  A member of the House of Representatives, Tony Nwulu (Lagos-PDP) says he has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) due to“ irreconcilable conflicts in the party.” Nwulu made this known at a news conference on Tuesday shortly after the plenary where he also announced his defection to the United Progressive Party (UPP) . He said he had written a letter of notice on his defection to the House Speaker, Mr Yakubu Dogara, dated July 24 on the issue. The law maker said he had informed the House leadership “to take notice that effective from the date above, I have resigned my membership of the PDP.” He said in his letter: “I wish, therefore, to by this letter convey my membership of the United Progressive Party (UPP) and to be accorded all rights and privileges emanating there from. “This defection is as a result of irreconcilable conflicts in my party and in accordance with Section 68 1(g) of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). “While assuring you of my continuous support to your leadership, my cooperation and loyalty to the legislative agenda of the House, please accept the assurances of my warmest regards as always.” When asked why he chose UPP as his new party, he said besides having a governorship ambition, the new platform was a better party to achieve his political ambition in Imo.
