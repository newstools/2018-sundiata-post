By Polycarp Auta  Bokkos (Plateau)   –       A youth group, Plateau G-17, on Thursday donated a 5,000 litre water tank to one of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps in Gassa, Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau. Mr Yakubu Danja, who presented the water tank on behalf of the group, said the gesture was informed by the scarcity of water and poor hygiene environment at the camp. “After a careful needs assessment at the camp, we realised that one of the major problems bedeviling the facility is lack of good drinking water. “So, we decided to provide this tank to enable the IDPs to store drinking water and it will also enable public-spirited individuals to provide water for them, when they know that they now have a storage facility, ” Danja said. He said the tank would also improve hygiene and health conditions of the displaced persons, as `water is key to healthy living’. Receiving the item of behalf of the beneficiaries, Mr Gyang Haruna, said water had been a serious challenge to them since they arrived at the camp. “Lack of good drinking and cooking water has been a serious challenge to us, and this has contributed to the poor hygiene in the camp. “So, we thank this group for coming to our aid, because our women and girls who suffer most, can now be relieved,” Hurana said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that over 12, 000 displaced persons are currently residing in nine camps, following the recent attacks on some villages in the state which claimed over 200 lives and and destroyed property worth millions of Naira.
