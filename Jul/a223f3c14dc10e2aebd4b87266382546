By Aminu Garko Minna –   Dr Bashir Yankuzo, Chief Imam, Central Mosque, Federal University of Technology, Minna on Friday called on intending pilgrims to fulfil all the hajj requirements and avoid things that would nullify their Hajj rites. Yankuzu, who made the call while delivering Jumma’at sermon, said Hajj was one of the five pillars of Islam with lots of lessons. “Muslims observe the Hajj because Allah command them to do so from as depicted in the various verses of the Glorious Qur’an. “An intending pilgrim should settle his or her debts and leave behind him or her clear record as well as write his or her will. “He or she should also ensure what he or she intends to pass to his or her family before embarking on the journey,’’ he said. According to the cleric, the need to leave a will behind is because the journey to Holy land may be the final journey for a pilgrim. He explained that Hajj was a unique and extra ordinary journey in the life time of all pilgrims, adding that it was also an invitation from Allah to the most famous acts of worship. The chief imam explained that the journey to Hajj required high level of patience, adding that though it was always accompanied with difficulties, fatigue, physical and social abnormalities and intolerance. He urged intending pilgrims to reflect on lessons from the life of Prophets, especially Prophet Ibrahim; who he said dedicated his life to monotheism, patience, hard work and sincerity of purpose. Yankuzu also called on intending pilgrims to pray for smooth and peaceful elections in the country.  (NAN)
