By Bushrah Yusuf-Badmus  Ilorin   –      A lecturer at the Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin, Mr Olatunbosun Odediran, has called for proper monitoring of public schools in the state. Odediran told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Ilorin that the state government should encourage parents to enroll their children or wards in public school by improving its standard. He said that there was lack of proper monitoring in public schools, which had made parents to prefer private schools. “The present economic condition is not favourable to most parents, hence, they will prefer to enroll their children in public schools, but they are of low standard. “They are less monitored, and this has affected the quality of teaching; this is why parents now prefer private schools, where their teachers and children are well monitored,’’ Odediran said. He added that urgent attention should be paid to address the dearth of facilities and the deplorable state of government owned schools across the state. “Government must improve on the infrastructure of these schools and also review the schools inspectorate department such that quality education will be assured. “The existence of private schools is to create option for parents or whoever is desirous of education”. According to him, the two school systems are essential but the public schools lack necessary facilities and many of them are in a state of dilapidation.
