According to him, the airline’s management made the pledge during a courtesy visit to the airline by the Assistant Inspector-General of Police (AIG), Lagos Airport Police Command, Mr Danjuma Ibrahim. The AIG lauded the management of the airline for its continuous collaboration with the police command. Ibrahim noted that the report he received when he assumed office indicated that the airline had over the years supported the command and appealed to the management to continue with the collaboration. He said the Airport Command was previously headed by an Assistant Commissioner of Police and later, a Commissioner of Police before the current improvement to Assistant Inspector General of Police. The AIG explained that his primary responsibility at the airport was to improve on the existing security network, adding that he was committed to actualising the task.
