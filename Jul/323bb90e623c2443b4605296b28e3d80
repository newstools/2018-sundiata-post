By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Group under the auspices of Nigeria Intervention Movement (NIM), has said it will report President Muhammadu Buhari to the international community over his increasing attempt to muzzle the democratic rights and freedom of the peoples of Nigeria using security forces. The group condemned the attempt by the security forces to prevent the senate President, Bukola Saraki and Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu from from attending their legislative duties at the national Asembly. National Publicity Secretary of the NIM, Mallam Nasser Kura who disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, informed that such anti-democratic behaviour and recklessness are capable of truncating Nigeria’s hard earned civil rule. The statement reads in full: Nigeria Intervention Movement (NIM) is deeply perturbed by the resort to panicky gestapo actions by the Nigerian Presidency, using security forces in the early hours of today, to prevent the Senate President, Bukonla Saraki and his deputy, Senator Ike Ekweremadu from attending to their constitutional legislative duties at the National Assembly. This ruthless show of force rather civil engagement being foisted on the leadership of the Nigerian Parliament by its Executive counterpart is to say the least anti- democratic, highhanded and reckless have the potential of truncating the life of Nigeria’s hard earned civil rule if caution is not quickly taken. NIM therefore call on President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately caution his men in the security apparatchik of Nigeria, so as to avoid the breakdown of order and a breach of the country’s peace and stability. We further wish to advise the leadership of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC that rather than employ arm twisting tactics, to urgently make amend by taking the right step in genuinely engaging and appeasing its teeming aggrieved leaders as the backlash of their current escapades in government is capable of rendering governance of the country totally comatose and chaotic at this critical period of the Nigeria’s economic downturn. Consequently, NIM as the vanguard of the third force movement of fresh breed political leaders in the country strongly demand an immediate refrain, remorse and unreserved apology to the leadership of the Senate of Nigeria to the Presidency for today’s reckless show of power against the parliamentary institution of the Nigerian peoples so as to avoid incurring a mass action from the third force movement; the type that can keep tongues wagging in the annals of Nigeria. In demonstration of our disapproval of today’s reckless siege on the representatives of the People and in order to prevent further occurrence of this sort of dastardly act by government, we in the leadership of the third force movement shall be forwarding a formal “Save the Soul of Democracy” Petition to the international community, especially the United Nations and the African Union, to prevail on the APC government to stop muzzling the democratic rights and freedom of the Peoples of Nigeria.
