By Martha Agas  Jos   –     Mr Joseph Ari, the Director General of Industrial Training Fund (ITF), has urged the people of Plateau to embrace peace. Ari made the plea on Thursday in Jos, in a condolence letter to Gov. Simon Lalong over the recent attacks of some communities, where lives were lost. According to him, the recent killings were inimical to the rapid development of the state. He stressed the need for the people to cooperate with security agencies to bring about sustainable peace in the state. The director general said that peace could only be achieved with concerted efforts of all and genuine commitment. “We join millions of Nigerians across the globe to commiserate with the governor and the people of Plateau on the recent killings in the state. “This incident is unfortunate and unwarranted, coming on the heels of almost three years of uninterrupted peace, owing to the efforts of the governor to restore the state as the `Home of Peace and Tourism,’’ he said. Ari condoled with the families of those who lost their loved ones in Barkin-Ladi, Riyom, Jos South and Bokkos Local Government Areas. The director general said that few people should not be given the chance to reverse the efforts of the governor in ensuring sustainable peace. NAN reports that Internally Displaced Persons, resulting from the attacks are seeking refuge in camps in Jos South, Riyom, Barkin Ladi and Mangu Local Government Areas.
