By Egbogota Clara Lagos –   The Lagos State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has called on Christians to intensify prayers for continued peace, unity, economic, social and political development in Nigeria. Apostle Alexander Bamgbola, Chairman of the chapter, made the call on Wednesday in Lagos. He was represented by the CAN State Secretary, Elder Isreal Akinadewo, at the special prayers and fasting at Hoares’ Memorial Methodist Cathedral, Yaba, Lagos. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the national body of the association on July 5 declared a three-day national fasting and prayers for Christians so as to end the killings in parts of the country. He said that continuous prayer was the solution to the challenges facing the country “When Christians understand the power behind the God that they are serving, they will know that there is no power that is greater than Him. “If it has to do with continuous prayer we will continue, we are not happy seeing innocent lives being wasted, the truth of the matter is after prayers there will be more prayers, until God answers our prayers,’’ he said. Akinadewo urged the government to rise up to its responsibility of protecting lives and property of Nigerians. He also urged government to prosecute suspects arrested for the killings across the country. “Nigerians are dying and it is not natural deaths, but they are being murdered daily, so we can’t rest on our oars. “The government should do the needful, when I say the needful it means they should find a way to stop the killings, human lives are sacred and should not be toyed with. “It has not affected you today does not mean it will not affect you tomorrow,’’ he said. Akinadewo said that with the collective effort by Nigerians through prayers the story of the country will change. “Prayer is the tool that can make the impossible become possible. We must use prayer to make Nigeria to become a better place  (NAN)
