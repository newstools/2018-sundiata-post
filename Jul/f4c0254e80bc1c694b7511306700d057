By Victor Nwachukwu Owerri –  The Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) has decried the spate of illegal distribution of drugs in Owerri.
Mrs Anthonia Aruya, Director, Inspection and Monitoring, PCN, said this on Friday while addressing newsmen in Owerri.
Aruya said it was required by law for all pharmaceutical facilities to be registered with PCN and to ensure continuous licensing in order to legally key into the drug distribution chain.
“The implication of not licensing is that drugs sold in such facilities cannot be guaranteed to have the same quality and efficacy as set by the manufacturers since they had not been subjected to regulatory control,” she said.
The director further said observations from the field in the state revealed that many people go into sale of medicines without following due process.
She described it as disheartening that many of the sellers of drugs in the state could not communicate in simple English.
According to her, such people go ahead to illegally operate at will to the detriment of the unsuspecting public.
Aruya therefore advised the general public to source their drugs from registered pharmacy outlets.
She warned that drugs in unregistered outlets cannot be guaranteed to be genuine. (NAN)
