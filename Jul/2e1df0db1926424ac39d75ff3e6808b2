By Yemi Adeleye  Lagos    –     A Lagos State lawmaker, Mr Tunde Braimoh, has urged the Ekiti Governor-Elect, Dr Kayode Fayemi to use the few months preceding his inauguration to articulate and evaluate issues for effective governance. Braimoh, the Chairman, House Committee on Judiciary, Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission, Petitions and Human Rights, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Monday. The lawmaker said that the Ekiti gubernatorial election had come and gone, with sovereignty belonging to the people. “The incoming governor should use these few months to dispassionately articulate, aggregate and evaluate issues. The legislator said that Fayemi should shun acrimony and put the interest of Ekiti people first. “The populist manifesto of the APC should be unveiled in Ekiti to give the people the greatest happiness, to justify the love and confidence given him (Fayemi). “He should bring the dividends of his tremendous goodwill to bear on the people, with a view to transforming the state. “To whom much is given, much is expected. Beneficiaries of political posts entrusted by the people must be principled and justify the people’s mandate at all times. “Being superficial, deceptive and dramatic with people’s welfare will end in rejection by the people,” Braimoh urged. NAN reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared Fayemi the winner of the Ekiti governorship election held on Saturday.
