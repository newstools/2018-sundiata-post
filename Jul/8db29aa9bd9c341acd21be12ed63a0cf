By Afusat Agunbiade-Oladipo Ilorin –   An Ilorin Magistrates’ Court on Friday remanded a 20-year-old labourer, Aliu Mohammed, for allegedly killing one Alimi Yahaya and stealing his motorcycle. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Jamiu Salihu, who declined to take the plea of the accused for lack of jurisdiction, ordered the accused to be remanded in prison. He also ordered the duplication of the case file and a copy sent to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. The case was adjourned till July 19 for further mention. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp Sani Abdullahi, had told the court that one Hussein Yahaya of Ilesha-Baruba in Baruten Local Government Area of Kwara had on June 8 reported at Ilesha-Baruba Divisional Police Headquarters that his brother, Alimi Yahaya, was missing. The complainant said the deceased had left his home at Ilesha-Baruba on June 7 with his unregistered Bajaj motorcycle and his whereabouts since then had been unknown. Luck, however, ran out on the accused when the police arrested him at Kosubosu with the deceased’s motorcycle and blood stains on his body. The accused, it was learnt, allegedly tricked the deceased into conveying him to a nearby village where he killed him and stole the motorcycle. The prosecutor told the court that the accused confessed to killing the deceased and hiding his corpse inside a bush at Ilesha-Baruba. He said the accused was arraigned on a two-count charge of armed robbery and culpable homicide which contravened Sections 1 (2) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provision) Act Cap RII Law of Nigeria, 2004 and 221 of the Penal Code.
