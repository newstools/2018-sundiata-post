By Muhammad Bashir Dutse –   The Society for Family Health (SFH) in collaboration with Federal Ministry of Health, has begun households mobilisation and data collation in preparation for the 2018 long-lasting insecticidal net replacement in Jigawa . The Campaign Manager, Mr John Ocholi, stated this in a news conference on the exercise in Dutse on Saturday. Ocholi said that the exercise, aimed to reduce the prevalence of malaria, would be conducted between July 21 and July 30 across the 27 local government areas of the state. “The household mobilisation will be carried out by household mobilisers for nine days; the mobilisers will go from house to house to register households and issue net cards,’’ Ocholi said. He explained that the replacement campaign started in December 2013 in Sokoto State. “So far, 77,586,714 long-lasting insecticidal nets have been distributed from 2013 to 2017 in 30 states,’’ he said. The campaign manager said that each card given to beneficiary would be exchanged for one long-lasting insecticidal net. According to him, a household could be given more than one net card, depending on its size and no household will be given more than four net cards, no matter its size. Ocholi further stated that no fewer than 3.6 million nets would be distributed to people in the state during the five-day distribution exercise, expected to begin on Aug. 11. He said that more than 20,000 trained personnel were engaged to conduct the exercise across the state. Ocholi explained that the beneficiaries would also be educated on how properly and effectively use the nets. He, therefore, urged residents to cooperate with the household mobilisers for the successful conduct of the exercise.
