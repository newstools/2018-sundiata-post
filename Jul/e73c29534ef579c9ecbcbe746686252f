By Oboh Linus  Maraba, –       Resident Pastor, Dunamis international Gospel Center, maraba 2, Israel Eliagwu has cautioned young ladies against being pregnant out of wedlock. Eligible, who gave the charge on Sunday at Dunamis international Gospel center, Mararaba 2, said it is not biblical for ladies to be coerced by any man in the guise of marriage to get pregnant for him. “Let me seize this opportunity to tell all the ladies that it is not right for any man to force or deceive you to get pregnant for him when you are not legally married to him. “It is not biblical, in fact it is a sin, if any man tells you or give a condition to get pregnant for him before marrying you, it means he did not love you. “Quit such relationships, it can ruin your life, there is no Bible tenet that says this, as Christians we should only follow what God says concerning marriage,” he said. Eliagwu said that this injunction becomes necessary because some men are taking undue advantage over ladies who are desperate to get married. He advised them to be careful of men that engaged in prolong courtship such as three to four years. “Six months is enough for a man to know some character of any lady he wants to marry, so do not stay in a relationship that last for three to four years without resulting in marriage,” he said. Eliagwu, who preached on dimension of dedication to God, from fourth chapter book of James, said that personal intimacy with God, commitment to soul winning and house of God, among others, are hallmark of dedication.
