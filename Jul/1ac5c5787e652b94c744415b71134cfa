By Franca Ofili Abuja –  Mr Joseph Ari, the Director-General, Industrial Training Fund (ITF), said 92 personnel of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) had been trained on various vocational skills. Ari, who was represented by Mrs Adesola Taiwo, the Director, Field service Department of ITF, said this in Abuja on Monday at the graduation of the personnel who comprised batch B of the Basic Works Skills Development Programme. He said the training which was for a period of three months, marked a milestone in the implementation of the training programme, collaboration between the Nigerian Air Force and ITF. According to him, the training will enable the personnel to improve on the jobs, which will in turn lead to a multiplier effect as other people learn from them. “We have been informed that this training will form part of criteria for promotion of the rank and file of NAF, as such we encourage the utilisation of the skills acquired. “The 92 participants graduating today were drawn from different commands and units across the country and have been trained for three months in six trade areas. “The areas are plumbing and pipe fitting, welding and fabrication, electrical installation, air condition and refrigeration, masonry and Computer Aided Design,’’ Ari said. He urged all employers of labour to train and re-train their workforce for continuous improvement in the work setting, adding that such would improve the Nigerian economy. Mrs Olayinka Shodunke, the Training Manager of Model Skills Training Centre (MSTC), said the event was the second and last batch of training for personnel of the force on basic work. Shodunke said that the event was water shed in the efforts by ITF to skill and re-skill Nigerian Armed Forces for efficient management of security stations across the country. She said that at the beginning of the year, the centre in collaboration with NAF came up with the course on basic works for 200 of its personnel to be trained for three months. (NAN)
