By Dada Ahmed Abuja –   As the nation warms for the 2019 general elections, the Chief Immam of Area 10,Mosque in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Alhaji Yahaya Al-Yolawi has urged Muslims in the territory to obtain their Permanent Voter cards (PVCs) . The cleric, who gave the advice on Friday in Abuja his Jumat sermon to the congregation, said this was to enable them elect leaders of their choice during the exercise. He noted that barely one yer to the general elections, some Muslims were yet to obtain PVCs as part of their efforts to perform their civic responsibility toward enhancing democracy and ensure political development of the country. The chief imam, whose sermon dwelt on “Commanding good and forbidding evil is a collective responsibility“, also called on Muslims to shun evil and continue to cherish in their deeds. “The act of commanding what is right and forbidding what is wrong is one of the most important Islamic teachings stressed in the Holy Quran. “If Muslims fail to do their duty of enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil, wrong doing and corruption will spread throughout the ummah (society),“he said. He also called on Muslims to see hating evil as part of their responsibilities toward sanitising the country of corruption and other negative tendencies capable of retarding the progress of the country. Al-Yolawi, who called on the security agents in the country to check the activities of some sects in their fledgling stage in some parts of the country to guard against crisis, prayed for the peace and development of the country.
