The Senator said who confirmed this while fielding questions from journalists at the APC National Secretariat after a meeting with the Party’s National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, added that he has confidence that Oshiomhole-led leadership has the capacity to and ability to address injustices facing the party. According to him, “We are confident that the new leadership of the Party has the capacity and the ability to address these injustices. In the words of Frantz Fanon, ‘We revolt because we cannot breathe’. So we revolted against how the Party was run because it is suffocating us. Now we have a new surgeon who is doing everything possible to put it back on track. That is why we give him the benefit of doubt that the problem can be solved.” Asked about his Party membership status, Sen. Shehu Sani retorted: “If I am here, I am an APC member. If I am not an APC member, you will not see me at the Party’s National Secretariat”
