By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja –  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commiserated with the Government and people of Katsina State over the devastating rainstorm that ravaged communities, causing death of 44 citizens and destruction of property. The party, in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Tuesday in Abuja urged the Federal and Katsina State governments to take urgent steps to assist the victims of this disaster. It also urged public-spirited individuals, organizations and groups to also support the state in assisting the victims. “It is painful that such disaster re-occurred in the state barely a month after a similar tragic incident resulted in deaths and destruction of property in various communities in the state. “The PDP particularly commiserates with the families of the victims of the flood, especially in Tundun Takari, Dan Tudu, Unguwar Kwakwa and Unguwar Mai Kwari communities, which were worse hit by the Sunday tragedy. “Indeed, our hearts and prayers go out to the bereaved, the wounded, the displaced as well all those who encountered various losses in this traumatic incident.” The party prayed for the repose of the souls of the victims.
