By Olukayode Babalola Lafia –  The Nasarawa State Fire Service says it recorded 17 fire incidents in the second quarter of 2018.
Alhaji Dogara Dalhatu, the state Chief Fire Officer (CFO), disclosed this in an interview with newsmen in Lafia on Thursday.
“During the period, we did not receive false alert, but out of the emergencies we got, three lives were lost while two were saved,” he said.
Dalhatu said about N9.9 million worth of properties were lost as a result of fire during the period, while estimated value of properties saved stood at N128 million.
He said the number of fire incidents recorded during the period was lower than that of the first quarter.
Dalhatu advocated for setting up of fire stations in all Local Government Areas (LGAs), and development areas in the state to reduce incidents of fire outbreaks across the state.
“It is expected that every LGA or development area should have a fire station.
“For instance, if there is an emergency in Nasarawa-Eggon LGA, you either rely on the Akwanga or Lafia fire station to nip in the bud.
“But getting to the area from both sides is difficult, I therefore appeal to the State Government to construct more fire stations across the state,” Dalhatu said.
He said that if fire outbreaks were reported on time, more lives and property would be saved as fire fighters would reach the areas early enough.
Dalhatu advised residents of the state to adhere to fire safety rules and regulations.
He appealed to government to provide more manpower to handle existing stations and to train fire fighters on modern ways of handling fire outbreaks.
“The fireman needs special training and constant retraining to adjust to modern trends in fire-fighting, modern equipment are coming in; thereby making it imperative for firemen to be trained on how to use them,’’ Dalhatu said. (NAN)
