By Nana Musa  Abuja    –        A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Tuesday sentenced three men to nine months imprisonment for stealing church properties. The judge, Inuwa Maiwada, sentenced Zubairu Ya’u, Abdulrahaman Saleh and Usama Ibrahim, who reside in Jabi, after they pleaded guilty to joint act, criminal trespass and theft. Maiwada, however, gave the convicts an option to pay N12, 000 fine each and advised them to be of good behaviour. The convicts begged the court for leniency and promised to be of a good behaviour. Earlier, the prosecutor, Ijeoma Ukagha, had told the court that Joy Ojehomon of Garki Abuja and Bala Abdullahi of Utako Abuja, reported the matter at the Utako Police Station, on July 15. She said on July 13, the convicts trespassed into their church and stole chairs, roofing sheet, tables and doors. Ukagha said they also stole a DVD player, stabilisers, a plasma TV and a gas cylinder. Ukahga said during police investigation, they confessed to committing the crime and begged for forgiveness. She said the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 79, 348 and 287 of the Penal Code.
