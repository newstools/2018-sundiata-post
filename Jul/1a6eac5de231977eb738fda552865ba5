By Emmanuel Antswen Makurdi –  NAN) The sacked Executive Chairman, Benue State Internal Revenue Service (BIRS), Mrs Mimi Adzape-Orubibi, says she was prevented from her entering her office to handover as directed by Gov. Samuel Ortom. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the chairman was sacked on Tuesday by the Benue governor in an early radio announcement. In a statement by her Media Aide, Mr Francis Terna, Adzape-Orubibi, alleged that the heavy deployment of non-conventional security guards to the office had tensed up the environment. The tax boss, who said the tense situation was not conducive for the hand over exercise, explained that “it is even impossible for me to access the office to carry out the governor’s instructions. “One will wonder why it is only the premises of BIRS and Urban Development that have been taken over by these men. “Other appointees, who were recently relieved of their duties, had a smooth handover in a calm and peaceful atmosphere. “This morning, upon hearing the news that Adzape-Orubibi has been relieved of her appointment some armed men suspected to be members of the Benue State Vigilante and Livestock Guards besieged the premises of the BIRS. “The men who claim to be acting on the instructions of the Benue State government have made the atmosphere at the board very tense and unsafe. “In view of the above, it has become impossible for Mrs. Orubibi to gain access into the corporate headquarters to carry out the Governor’s directive to hand over’’. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that there has been a whirlwind of sacks in Ortom’s cabinet.
Recently, out of 13 commissioners nine were sacked, while 13 Special Advisers were also relieved of their appointments. (NAN)
