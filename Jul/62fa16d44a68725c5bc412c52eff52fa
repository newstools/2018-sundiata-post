By Adedeji Egbebi‎ Ado-Ekiti –   The Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Nigeria on Friday, called on all political parties and politicians to be orderly during the state governorship election on Saturday. The organisations, which comprised of more than 70 groups in Ekiti, made the appeal in a statement from their situation room, which was made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ado-Ekiti. The civil society organisations charged all the leaders of the political parties and the politicians to comport themselves well at the polling units and cast their votes for the candidates of their choice. The organisations equally charged security agencies, including the Nigerian Army, the Nigeria Police, the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps to ensure the safety of election observers and the electorate. The groups urged voters to adhere strictly to the rules and regulations of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to avoid any harassment by the security officers. NAN reports that some of the civil society organisations that jointly released the statement include: Policy and Legal Advocacy Centre (PLAC), CLEEN Foundation, Action Aid Nigeria. Others are Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), Proactive Gender Initiative (PGI), Enough is Enough Nigeria, WANGONET and Partners for Electoral Reform, among others.  (NAN)
