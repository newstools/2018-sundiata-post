By Akeem Abas Ibadan –  The Oyo State Government has decried the slow pace of work on some ongoing road projects in the state, warning that such contracts might be revoked if the contractors failed to speed up work. Mr Wasiu Dauda, the State Commissioner for Works and Transport, gave the warning on Tuesday during the inspection tour of ongoing road projects. The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that the team had inspected the dualisation of Agodi-Gate-Old Ife road, expansion of Oke-Adu- Iwo road interchange, Idi Ape- Bashorun-Akobo road and Moniya- Iseyin road projects. He stated that the contractors had failed to complete the projects at the time agreed upon when the contracts were awarded. Dauda said the present administration was determined to speed up the completion of the road projects to ease the hardship being faced by residents. The commissioner urged the contractors to boost their output in order to meet up with the government deadline. “We are inspecting some of the ongoing projects in the state. The pace of work at the ongoing rehabilitation of the Moniya-Iseyin road is too slow. “It is important for the contractors to fast-track action on these projects. “ I am not satisfied with the level of their work and people have even questioned the government on why work is slow or delayed. “We want the contractors to speed up their work,” he said. Dauda appealed to residents and motorists plying the roads to be more patient, adding that government was doing all within its capacity to ensure the projects were completed before the end of the administration. Mr Okeke Kenechukwu, the Project Manager of Chevret Nig. Ltd handling the Iwo road-Old Ife road project, promised that his firm would deliver on schedule. (NAN)
