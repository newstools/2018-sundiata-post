By Yemi Adeleye Lagos –   The All Progressives Congress (APC), Scandinavia Countries Chapter, says Dr Kayode Fayemi’s second coming would usher in people-oriented programmes in Ekiti.
The group made the declaration at a news conference in Lagos.
The Chairman of the chapter, Mr Ayoola Lawal congratulated Fayemi on his victory in the July 14, gubernatorial election.
“It is no brainer that the governor-elect second coming is to continue the APC people centered policies and a mission he embarked upon during his first term.
“If there is anyone in doubt of the Ekiti people`s trust and confidence in Fayemi and the APC-led Federal Government, the Saturday’s election victory was the plain answer,” he said.
The APC Diaspora chieftain urged the governor-elect to continue to work smartly and creatively in bringing the state up to speed in meeting the challenges of the economy.
Lawal urged Fayemi to vindicate the naysayers with his unbeatable legacy.
He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), security agencies local and international observers for the role they played in the success of the election.
“The trust and faith in our electoral system is the fulcrum of our fragile democracy and thanks to INEC for consolidating on its achievements in the previous elections.
“However, more could still be done, I am certain that the forthcoming Osun election will be another repeat victory for the APC,” Lawal said.  (NAN)
