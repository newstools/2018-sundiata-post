By Suzzy Tolofari Abuja –   The Comptroller-General, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), retired Col. Hameed Ali, on Tuesday presented certificates to the first 40 graduates of Junior Course 01/2018 in a bid to improve service delivery. Ali who made the presentation at the graduation of junior course 01/2018 at the Service Command and Staff College, Gwagwalada, Abuja urged them to put into practice what they had learnt. “I urge you to make use of the skills you learnt in the past three months. “This is because every course you undertake matters in the process of the Service, therefore, I urge you to be modest and to fear God in your dealings. “In June, we were here for the graduation of Senior Course 01/2018, and now we are here for that of junior course. “It is the desire of the NCS to keep improving capacity building of its personnel,’’Ali said. According to him, the graduates of course 01 are the pioneers of the course in the NCS, I therefore, urge them to make a change with what they have learnt from the course to improve service delivery. Ali said that the challenging part of the three point mandate given to him by Mr President when he assumed duty as CGC, was the reform of the NCS. He said that the reform process was a challenge because it takes time for people to change. The three-pronged mandate given to the CGC by Mr President, include to restructure, reform and to generate revenue. The Assistant Comptroller-General, and Commandant of the College, Charles Edike said the new graduates were the first set of junior course 01. Edike said the College runs programmes for both senior and junior officers to boost their capacity for effective service efficiency. “We will continue to train officers that will make the difference in the Service. “We will be having two more courses before the end of the year for junior course,’’ Edike said.
