By Joshua Oladipo  Osogbo   –    Three persons were docked on Monday at an Osogbo Chief Magistrates’ Court in Osun over alleged fraud of N6.3 million. The trio: Kamilu Abayomi, 25; Bakare Abibu, 22; and Hameed Adekola, 44 are facing a five-count charge bothering on fraud, theft, attempt to kill and conspiracy. The prosecutor, Insp. Razak Lamidi, told the court that the accused conspired among themselves to defraud one Adeosun Funmilayo of N6.3 million. Lamidi said that the fraud was perpetrated under the pretext that they wanted to transact a business with her which they knew was false. He said that the accused collected N6.3 million from the complainant and disappeared. He said that they were later traced to their whereabouts and arrested by the police intelligence units. Lamidi said the trio used some `juju’ powers to hypnotize Funmilayo which made her become unconscious before collecting the amount from her. The prosecutor said the offences committed by the accused contravened Sections 86 (2), 516, 419,383,390 and 381. He said that they were punishable under Section 390(9) of the Criminal Code, Cap 34 Vol. 11 Laws of Osun, 2003. The defence counsel, Mr Bola Ige, prayed the magistrate to grant his client bail in the most liberal terms. The magistrate, Mrs Modupe Awodele, granted the accused bail in the sum of N1 million and two sureties each in like sum. Awodele said that the sureties must be residing within the court’s jurisdiction, produce evidence of tax payments and two passports sized photographs, attached to an affidavit of means. She said one of the sureties must be a civil servant on Grade Level 15, while the others must be close relatives to the accused persons. The magistrate adjourned the case to Aug. 27 for hearing.
