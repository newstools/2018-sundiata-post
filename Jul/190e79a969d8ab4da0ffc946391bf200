By Johnson Eyiangho Abuja –   The Nigerian Army has pledged to collaborate with the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Study (NIPSS), in addressing security challenges in view of its enormous human resource and capacity. The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai made the pledge on Friday when he received the National President, Khaleel Bolaji and other members of the Alumni Association of NIPSS in Abuja. Buratai said “we are very much aware of the enormous human resource, and capacity that the association has.’’ The army chief noted that those resource and capacity had to do with the “issues of security, development, military technology and thinking.’’ He described NIPSS’s alumni as highly respected, noting that it had capacity to support contemporary issues, thereby contributing to national development. “We will continue to support your programmes as you execute them in the interest of humanity,’’ Burati said.
