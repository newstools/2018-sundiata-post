By Christian Ogbonna Yenagoa –  The National Population Commission (NPC) in Bayelsa has expressed dissatisfaction with the low recording of births in the state, urging parents to support the campaign and register the birth of their children. The commission disclosed that it registered no fewer than 64, 651 births between January 2017 and June 2018. Mrs Gloria Izonfuo, NPC Federal Commissioner in Bayelsa, disclosed this during a sensitisation rally as part of activities to mark the 2018 World Population Day on Wednesday in Yenagoa. Izonfuo said the theme of the 2018 World Population Day is “Family Planning is Human Right” was also to sensitise the people to the need for child spacing. She explained that proper child spacing would guarantee healthy living for the family, reduce financial strain as well as ensure that the mother was in good health condition before becoming pregnant. “There is need for registration of births and in Bayelsa, the performance has been very low and as it stands, the state is behind because we are not meeting up with the target set by the commission.’’ Izonfuo said that Family Planning (FP) was a pathway to achieving Demographic Dividend (DD) in the country. She also said that it was fundamental to the realisation of 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development Goals and strategy for national progress.  (NAN)
