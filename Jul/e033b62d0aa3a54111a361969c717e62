The Director of Resettlement and Compensation Department, FCDA, Alhaji Baba-Kura Umar, said following a directive by FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, an expanded implementation committee was set up to ensure seamless relocation exercise. The officials interacted with hundreds of stakeholders from Apo, Akpmajenya and Garki villages inside the Sa’peyi of Garki palace on the planned relocation of the people to Apo Resettlement area. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that this is coming against the backdrop of reinvigorated effort toward relocating original inhabitants of Garki Chiefdom to Apo Resettlement area. Umar disclosed that the government has since commenced issuance of letters of intent to the original inhabitants of Garki, warning that the document is not transferable. He said that it is a continuous exercise; hence the need for the affected people to be patient as everyone will be properly carried along. Responding, the Sa’peyi of Garki, Alhaji Usman Nga-Kupi, who expressed satisfaction with the resettlement plan, thanked stakeholders for their cooperation in the process. He said the title documents being given to them are for their children, warning them against trading such document. The chief also warned them to avoid being shut out of ongoing relocation scheme. “Do not sell your papers, because it will amount to selling your children’s future, as community leaders will not intervene in anyway. “Some of you who have gotten your letters of intent should protect it jealously, to prevent losing and damaging such,’’ he stressed.
