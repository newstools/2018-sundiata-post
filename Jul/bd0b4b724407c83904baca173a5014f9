By Chimezie Anaso Umunya(Anambra) –  The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) says it is partnering with various security agencies and other stakeholders to ensure safety of corps members ahead of the 2019 general elections. The Director-General of the corps, Brig.-Gen. Sule Kazaure, said this at the Umunya Temporary Orientation Site, Anambra, when he visited the 2018 Batch B youths corps members in the state as part of his nationwide tour of NYSC Orientation camps. Kazaure said talks on the partnership had been fruitful and that there was nothing to worry about the safety of corps members who would be engaged in election duties. He urged the corp members to respect the culture and tradition of communities where they would be posted, while encouraging them to avoid nocturnal and lone movements for security reasons. “We are in touch with all the security agencies in the country and they have assured that the security of corps members is guaranteed. “We also have a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and that MoU covers the security of corps members and with that, we have no problem,” he said. The director-general also urged the corps members to take advantage of the various development and discipline instilling activities in the camp as well as the skills being taught there. He thanked the Anambra Government for its efforts at completing the Permanent Orientation Camp at Umuawulu/Mbaukwu Awka South Council Area. Mr Kehinde Aremu, Coordinator of the NYSC in Anambra, thanked the director-general for the visit and his inspection of the camp.  (NAN)
