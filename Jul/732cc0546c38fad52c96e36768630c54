By Ummul Idris Abuja –   Dr Mercy Luka, a family physician, has advised nursing mothers not to deny their babies enough breast feeding as it has nothing to do with sagging of breasts.
Luka told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Abuja that that breast feeding does not cause breasts to sag, but ageing.
She said that it was natural for aging to result to change in body structure and sagging of breasts.
“Do not let worries about sagging breasts deter you from breast feeding your baby.
“Breast milk is still the best food for a growing infant.
“The breast undergoes changes in size due to the changes your body goes through during pregnancy.
“That makes the difference and not whether you breast feeds a child,’’ she said.
She said that research has shown that if the breast kept moving too freely without a properly fitted bra, breast may stretch the cooper’s ligaments (connective tissues) and will lead to sagging.
Luka said that changes in weight due to gain weight and loss could affect the hormones and make the breast sag.
She added that sagging was unavoidable because of the way breasts were built with fats, glands, milk ducts and cooper’s ligaments.
The physician said that as one gets older, the breasts would be losing the fight with gravity.
However, she said that wearing a properly fitted and supportive bras and breast lifting can help reduce sagging. (NAN)
