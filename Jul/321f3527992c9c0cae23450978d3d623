By Sheila Effiong  Abuja,   –     Some commuters and residents of the Federal Capital Territory have extolled Thursday’s inauguration of the First Phase of the Abuja metro rail line by President Muhammadu Buhari. The rail line, which connects the Abuja city centre and the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, terminates at the Standard Gauge Railway Station in Idu, with the complete network planned to link Abuja with satellite towns such as Nyanya, Kubwa, Maraba (Nasarawa state) and Lugbe.
