By Olaitan Idris  Lagos   –     A 49-year-old real estate agent, Agboola Jones, who allegedly defrauded the Ministry of Defence Multipurpose Cooperative Society of N15 million, was on Thursday brought before a Surulere Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Jones, whose residential address was not given, pleaded not guilty to a three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining by false pretences and stealing. The prosecutor, Insp. Ikechukwu Edumodior, told the court that the accused and others still at large, committed the offences on May 30 at Epe in Lagos State. The prosecutor said that Jones and his accomplices currently at large, fraudulently obtained N15 million from the Ministry of Defence Multipurpose Cooperative Society. Edumodior said the society had employed the services of the accused to find a land suitable for farming for its members. He said that after the accused had assured some of the members of the society that there was a parcel of land for lease, the society transferred N15 million into his bank account. He said that when Jones failed to keep his own part of the deal, the society reported the matter to the police. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 287, 314 and 325 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 325 (1) provides seven years’ imprisonment for conspiracy to defraud. The chief magistrate, Mrs Oluyemisi Adelaja, granted the accused bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She adjourned the case until Aug. 6, for substantive trial.
