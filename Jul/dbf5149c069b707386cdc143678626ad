By Hauwa Gold   Sokoto   –      Sokoto State government’s introduction of Cash Transfer Programme has improved enrolment of girls in schools and encouraged women to return to school, the state Commissioner for Basic Education, Prof. Aisha Madawaki, said on Thursday. Madawaki said in an interview with the News Agency of Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Sokoto that the programme provides support to poor parents to enable them send their female children to school without interruption. According to her, the measure has boosted girls’ education and and allowed women who had dropped from school to return. The commissioner noted that several interventions by donor agencies like UNICEF and DFID have helped in turning the education sector in the state around for good. “The serious gaps in the education sector made the state government to declare a state of emergency in the sector. “The statistics on education in Sokoto state was not only worrisome, but regrettable, but with the new policy in place, government is able to reverse the negative trend for the benefit of the state. “There are so many interventions by the international community doing projects in some local governments of the state to improve access to education. “There are also projects going on to help women in going back to school to further their education,” she said.
