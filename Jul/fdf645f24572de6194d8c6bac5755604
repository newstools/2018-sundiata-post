By Blessing Ibegbu  Mararaba    –      A Mararaba Upper Area Court in Nasarawa State on Wednesday dissolved the five-year-old marriage between one Ruth Makama, and her husband, Samuel Samura, over lack of care and battery. The judge, Ibrahim Shekarau, dissolved the marriage in the interest of peace, saying that the parties had ceased to be husband and wife henceforth. “The parties are to maintain peace all the time; any violation of the order of this court will amount to contempt and of course attract grave consequences. “Also, the parties should collect their divorce certificate from the registrar’s office,’’ he stated. Earlier, Ruth had told the court that she was married to the respondent in 2013 and the union did not produce any child. She said the respondent did not care for her, often disrespected and was always beating her. Ruth pleaded with the court to dissolve the marriage, saying there was no longer love in the union. The respondent, who was absent in court, sent a letter consenting to the divorce.
