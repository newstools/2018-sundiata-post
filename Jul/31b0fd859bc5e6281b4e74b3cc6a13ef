By Muhammad Auwal  Yola   –       Hajia Fatimatu Alfa, the Adamawa Coordinator of the Federal Government Schools Feeding Programme, has said that more than 400,000 pupils had been targeted in the programme scheduled for September. Alfa made this disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yola on Friday. She explained that the programme was initially scheduled for March but due to some challenges it was shifted to September. According to her, the state government has recorded a high increase of school enrollment across the state since the announcement of the programme early this year. She said that the programme would engage no fewer than 5,000 women food vendors. Alfa noted that the programme was also designed to encourage school enrollment, women empowerment as well as support young local farmers by purchasing their produce. She said that the programme had started in six states in the North East geopolitical zone except Adamawa.
