By Chibuike Nwabuko  Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Senator representing Kaduna central senatorial district at the National Assembly, Comrade Senator Shehu Sani has thrown his weight behind the move by the Federal Government to publish the names of selected 200 Nigerians with illegally acquired properties in Abuja.  The Kaduna senatot described it as a good idea on Sunday when he took to his twitter handle @Shehusani and said: “FG decision to publish the names of selected 200 Nigerians with illegally acquired properties in Abuja is a good idea. Asking the FCTA to publish the names of ALL the elected & appointed officials with properties in FCT from 1999 & when they acquired them is a better idea”.  Sundiata Post recalls that Chairman, Special Presidential Investigative Panel for the Recovery of Property, Okoi Obono-Obla, on Friday said that the Federal Government has disclosed plan to unveil 200 names of people who own illicit property in Maitama Abuja. He disclosed this during the launch of Property Tracker Platform by the Africa Network for Environment and Economic Justice (ANEEJ), which will aid in tracking down these illegal properties. Obla, who is also the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Prosecution, said the Presidency would collaborate with ANEEJ and make available to it 200 names of people with massive property in Maitama Abuja, purchased with illegally-acquired funds, adding that the people must be held accountable to disclose how they got the property. According to him,  “That is why we have intensified fight against corruption. Anybody that has taken what does not belong to him should return it back to Nigeria, otherwise, we are going to track him down and force him to return the money back to Nigeria, and we are starting by providing names of 200 past and present public service holders with massive property in Maitama Abuja”
