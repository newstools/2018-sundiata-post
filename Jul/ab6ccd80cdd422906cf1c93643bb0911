By EricJames Ochigbo Abuja –   The Speaker of House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara, has congratulated the President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, on his victory at the Supreme Court on Friday. Dogara in a statement issued on Friday in Abuja by his Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs, Mr Turaki Hassan, said he received the news of the apex court’s verdict with joy. He said that the judgment had reinforced confidence in the judiciary as last hope of the people. Saraki had faced trial on 18-count charges bordering on false declaration of assets before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) since 2015. “The judgment of the Supreme Court today has once again reinforced our confidence and belief in the nation’s judiciary as the last hope of the common man. “As democrats, this has again reaffirmed the independence of the judiciary as protected by our Constitution under the doctrine of Separation of Powers and principles of Checks and Balances. “No doubt, the Supreme Court’s judgement will help in no small way in strengthening the independence of the legislature as the first organ of government under our constitutional democracy and presidential system of government,” he said. The speaker said that the almost three-year trial had been finally put to rest and had shown that no matter the allegations, only the truth prevailed in the end. He commended the doggedness and fighting spirit exhibited by Saraki who refused to be distracted by the long trial and remained resolute and focused on his legislative duties as President of the Senate. Dogara urged Saraki to see the trial as a test to his leadership and forgive and put it behind.  (NAN)
