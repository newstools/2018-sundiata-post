By Deborah Akpede  Ikeja,   –      A 23-year-old jobless uncle, Everness Onyebuchi , who allegedly defiled his eight-year-old niece, was on Thursday remanded at Kirikiri Prison by an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The Magistrate, Mrs B.O Osunsanmi, who refused to take the plea of the accused, ordered that he should be kept behind bars pending advice from the State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). “Based on the sensitivity of the case, it is difficult to grant bail. Bail will be the discretion of the court. “Case file should be documented and send to office of the DPP for advice,’’ she said. Onyebuchi, who resides with the girl’s parents at Oshodi, Lagos, is being tried for defilement. The Prosecutor, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that accused committed the offence in May at the girl parents’ residence. He said that the accused severally had canal knowledge of his niece. “The accused had sexual intercourse with the girl on several occasions,’’ Ayorinde said. The prosecutor said that the father of the girl accommodated the accused when he needed a place to stay. “The accused started sleeping with her not long after he moved into the girl parents’ house due to lack of accommodation. “The housekeeper, who noticed changes in the girl’s behaviour and body, informed her parents. “The girl’s parents interrogated her and she told them what her uncle used to do to her when nobody was at home. “The case was reported and the accused was arrested,’’ the prosecutor said. The offence contravened Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015(Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the section prescribes life imprisonment for defilement. The case was adjourned until Aug. 13.
