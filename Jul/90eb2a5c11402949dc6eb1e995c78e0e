By Naomi Sharang/Cecilia Ijuo Abuja –  Sen. Ali Ndume has called on Nigerians to continue to keep faith with the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
Ndume made the appeal when he visited the Managing Director of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Mr Bayo Onanuga, on Monday in Abuja.
The lawmaker said the present administration was working hard to ensure that Nigerians enjoyed the dividends of democracy.
He commended Onanuga for believing in the administration and remaining steadfast in spite of the pressure from some quarters to discourage President Muhammadu Buhari’s supporters.
“I personally want to appreciate you for being part of what we believe in and that is the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari.
“You have been in the struggle and you have been very consistent and I commend you for that.
“Many have gotten frustrated and left but you remained.
“I was discussing with a supporter of the President and I was encouraging him to remain steadfast because he is also thinking of leaving.
“Let us continue pushing. I pray it gets better,” he said.
Responding, Onanuga commended the legislator for identifying with the agency and appearing on its flagship platform, the NAN Forum.  (NAN)
