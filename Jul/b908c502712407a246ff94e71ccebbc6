By Mustapha Sumaila Abuja –   The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has threatened to sanction driving schools involved in certificate racketeering.
Mr Bisi Kazeem, the Corps Public Education Officer, said this in a statement on Monday in Abuja.
Kassim quoted the FRSC Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, saying that the corps had declared war against driving school certificate racketeering and would not spare anyone caught in the act.
Oyeyemi said he had called on members of the driving school profession to appreciate the responsibility they owe the society through credible discharge of their tasks.
He advised them to uphold the ethics and standards of the profession.
Oyeyemi enjoined the Association of Driving School Operators of Nigeria (ACDSON) and the Association of Driving School Instructors of Nigeria (ADSIN) during a national workshop to comply with the standard.
The corps marshal charged the participants to use the opportunity to critically examine how they could find new ways of improving on the quality of driver education and road safety in Nigeria.
He said that the corps needed the assistance and cooperation of all to succeed in the campaign by putting a firm check on this scourge threatening the security of lives and properties.
“At moments like this, while imbibing new ideas, it is necessary to appraise the ongoing with the aim of seeing and correcting grey areas,” he said.
He recalled that some driving schools had been suspended from the portal for some time now due to sharp practices like illegally graduating trainees in less than the legally prescribed 26 mandatory hours.  (NAN)
