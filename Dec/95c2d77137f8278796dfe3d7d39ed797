By Mohammed Lawal  Sabongari    –        Alhaji Fahad Ahmed-Chikaji, a Peoples’ Redemption Party (PRP) candidate for Kaduna State House of Assembly on Monday urged Christians to use the Christmas season to pray for peaceful 2019 General Elections. Fahad-Chikaji, who is contesting for the seat of Sabongari state constituency, stated this in a Christmas message to Christians in his constituency. He said the call became necessary in view of the fact that peace was not only critical to the success of the elections, but also a path to building a greater society. Fahad-Chikaji, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of Arewa Youth Trust Foundation, appealed to Christians to have sober reflection on the reason for the Christmas celebrations. He urged them to emulate the teachings of Jesus Christ for peace and tolerance could only be achieved through their interactions and actions towards others. He said: “I want to enjoin our friends, the Christian faithful, to use this festive season to promote love, unity and tolerance among themselves and extend it to those of other religious faiths for national cohesion. “The Almighty God created us not to fight each other, but to live together in peace with one another. “We must learn to tolerate, embrace and accommodate one another toward building a great nation. “This is a season of love, season of gift and season of peace, you should therefore try to promote such values for the common good of all.’’ Fahad-Chikaji noted that neither the Qur’an nor the Bible encouraged violence, chaos or breach of peace. He said the two religions always preached peace, love and unity among their adherents, stressing the need for both Muslims and Christians to accommodate and tolerate each other’s faith. Fahad-Chikaji also used called on all Nigerians to do all within their powers to ensure hitch-free 2019 elections.
