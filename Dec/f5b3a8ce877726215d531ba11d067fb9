By: Oyekan Zainab  Jos    –       An Upper Area Court 1, Kasuwan Nama in Jos, on Tuesday, sentenced a 15-year-old student, to two years in prison for the attempted rape of a seven-year-old girl. The Judge, Lawal Suleiman, who sentenced the student without an option of fine, said it would serve as a deterrent. Earlier, the prosecutor, Ibrahim Gokwat told the court that the case was reported on May 25 at the Laranto Police station by one Mohammed Sani of Fabuna Katako, the victim’s father. The prosecutor told the court that the convict lured the girl into one uncompleted building and attempted to rape her. On arraignment, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge and begged the court for leniency. Gokwat said the offence contravened the provisions of Section 275 of the penal code law of Northern Nigeria.
