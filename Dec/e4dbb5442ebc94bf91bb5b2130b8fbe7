By Omowunmi Alake  Lagos   –      An NGO, Women Equality in Society, on Wednesday urged the three tiers of government to empower women with capabilities for active citizenship and leadership roles at all levels. Mrs Towobola Williams, the Director of the organisation, made the plea in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Williams said that every woman needed to be trained to become prospective leaders in the society and also to be useful to their immediate families. “We are calling on our government, from the national level to the local level to support women in becoming an active part of governance and development of our nation. “An increased number of skilled and knowledgeable women can promote gender equality in leadership roles and decision making in every sector of the economy, and at all levels with adequate support. “This can also increase the numbers of articulate women who are capable of speaking out, raising women’s demands, and participating in promoting women as agents of change in our present day Nigeria. “This will enable women to become important members of the society, influencing all stakeholders and the wider communities. “It will build their capabilities and potential to participate in politics and being a good leader in the society,’’ she said. Williams said that massive advocacy and sensitisation could positively influence and change the mind-set of women. According to her, it is important to encourage women to support each other in order to individually and collectively work together to achieve gender equality in leadership roles. She, however, advised government at all levels and organisations to provide and support women with the platforms to voice their opinions and ideas for women’s full and effective participation in leadership roles. “We want political parties to support more women in politics to take up leadership roles in order to empower them to become an active citizen,’’ Williams said.
