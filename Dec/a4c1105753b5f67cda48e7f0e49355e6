By Igbaugba Ehigimetor  Benin –  The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo, on Saturday, inaugurated its youth campaign coordinators for Ovia Federal Constituency. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the coordinators were inaugurated at Oluku, with a charge to deliver President Muhammadu Buhari and all the candidates of the party in the Federal Constituency. Director General of the APC campaign in Ovia, Mr Charity Amayanevbo, who inaugurated the coordinators, said the party aims to record 99 percent victory in the 2019 general elections. He urged incumbent lawmaker representing Ovia Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Ms Omosede Igbinedion of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to start preparation for life outside the National Assembly (NASS). Amayanevbo urged the youth coordinators to immediately begin grassroots mobilisation so as to sweep the PDP out of Ovia. He said President Buhari needs a friendly and patriotic NASS to perform more effectively. “What happened in 2015, when we mistakenly elected someone who does not care for the youths, will not happen again. “We know the importance of women and youths during elections. They are our vital organs to drive the campaigns. “We are going to sweep the remnants of the PDP out of Ovia. All the coordinators are to inaugurate youths in the wards and unit levels,” he said. Candidate of the APC for the House of Representatives, Mr Dennis Idahosa, challenged the coordinators to go and deliver votes for the party. Idahosa promised that Ovia would witness unprecedented development with him in the NASS. He said the coming election is to vote out those causing impediments to the administration of Buhari. Similarly, the Youth Leader of Evboneka, Mr Omoregbe Omoregie, said they were ready to support the APC to victory. Youths picked to lead the campaigns in Ovia are Osasere Osaroyogie, Desmond Orhue, Matthew Idurobo, Perry Egbon, Edosa Ogieame and Richard Ogbomosho. (NAN)
