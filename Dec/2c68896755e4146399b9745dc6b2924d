By Nicholas Dechi Makurdi –   The Benue Government says no official document was affected in the fire at the generating plant of the Government House, Makurdi.
This was contained in a statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Samuel Ortom, Mr Terver Akase and issued to newsmen in Makurdi on Wednesday.
“We wish to clarify that the fire which gutted the generating plant at the Benue Peoples House, Makurdi earlier today did not affect any other facility.
“The fire resulted from an electrical fault at the maintenance section and badly affected the generating plant.
“It was however, put off before it could spread to other installations.
“Investigation has shown that the fire was purely an accident and not an act of sabotage, as all official documents in the adjoining buildings are safe and intact,” he said.  (NAN)
