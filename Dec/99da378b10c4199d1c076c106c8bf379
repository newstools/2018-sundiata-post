By Deji Abdulwahab  Abuja   –       Abuja Environmental Protection Board (AEPB) has advised the residents in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to imbibe the habit of keeping their environment clean before, during and after the yuletide period. The Board’s Head of Information and Outreach Unit, Mr Muktar Ibrahim, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja on Sunday. “As we are going to witness yuletide period, while wishing FCT residents happy celebration, they should imbibe the habit of cleanliness around them. “They should package their waste properly and ensure that they have functional dust bins to prevent throwing waste indiscriminately. “Essentially, residents should maintain all the environmental rules during this season,” the information officer said. He said that AEPB had stepped up its implementation of environmental duties to address waste generation during this festive period. “AEPB has stepped up its monitoring and supervision in all the districts and also ensure that all the cleaners are always discharging their duties during this season,” he said. Ibrahim, who said that AEPB has 27 cleaning contractors, said that the board had a supervisor in each contracting company to ensure prompt discharge of environmental duties in the FCT. He added that the board was planning to increase the number to 48 in the new contract.
