By Esenvosa Izah  Lagos –  An NGO, Young Breed Organisation, has called on the Federal Government to create an enabling environment for youths to thrive and contribute to nation building in 2019. Its founder, Mr Abraham Owoseni, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday, in Lagos. “The world of young people is faced with a myriad of challenges, primarily as a result of dysfunctional mindsets on career, finance and relationships, among others. “But in every society, young people stand in the vanguard of change, nation building and economic transformation. “The high demographic population of youths in Nigeria is a plus and pointer to this fact that the Nigerian youth is the new oil for the nation. “However, this will become feasible when young people are equipped to make meaningful and well informed life decisions, from teenage years all through to transitioning into adulthood. “Therefore, it is important for government to ensure that it creates the opportunities and enabling environment for youths to thrive,” Owoseni said. He said that his organisation was advocating a holistic human capital development for youths in the country. According to him, holistic refers to a total man concept for the development of young people. ”This concept sees to it that young people are equipped in various areas of life, thus avoiding any possible lacuna in the growth process. ”Since 2013, Young Breed has been promoting human capital development for young people through Life Skills Based Education (LSBE). “Hitherto, children and youths development programmes, such as the Youth Development Conference and Youth Development Clubs, among others, have directly groomed over 6, 191 beneficiaries of young people. “With continued efforts of more NGOs, faith and community-based organisations and the enabling framework from government, this task of human capital development can be mainstreamed and boosted, ” he said.
