Celebrity photographer, Michael Tubes in an exclusive interview with NET TV, speaks about the other side of Nigerian celebrity artistes fans do not see. As one of the most popular concert photographers, Tubes has worked with most Nigerian artistes. Speaking about Mavin’s first lady, Tiwa Savage, Tubes revealed that she is a workaholic and was working back to back in preparation for her London tour just as Wizkid whose instrumentals are a delight to the ear. He said “Davido has a very lovely heart. When Tiwa had a show in London, when was working back to back and you can just sit down and listen to Wizkid’s instrumentals, I’ll just say he is a genius.” Describing Adekunle Gold, he said, “He’s very creative, very spontaneous, he knows what he wants, he is very focused”. On Asa, he remarked, “She is not your typical artiste. From the beat, from the guitar, from her back up singers, the way she dances and moves, she gives you that one thousand per cent experience. He also spoke about Yemi Alade and a host of others. See his full interview here.
