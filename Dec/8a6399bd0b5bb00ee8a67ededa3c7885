She told residents to be cautious of type of persons they offered alms, stressing that many of those parading the streets as handicapped were mere pretenders. Responding on behalf others, a beneficiary simply identified as Nneka commended the state government for the gesture. She gave the assurance that they would use the money and other items donated to them prudently and stay off street begging.
