You are a Yorubaman. You are on Facebook shouting yourself to death: “Looters must not come back.” That is what you are fed. And that is your signature tune. And EFCC is providing ‘juicy but false tales’ everyday to sustain the narrative of Buhari-is-fighting-corruption. But Yemi Osibajo, Vice-President, just told you that his main, and perhaps his own Yoruba reason, for supporting Buhari for 2019 is for the Presidency to return to South-west in 2023! Even if the nation is subjected to another FOUR years of ineptitude, nepotism and rudderless leadership, it does not matter. As long as he or his master, becomes President. As a Yoruba man or woman reading this, ask yourself: WHAT DID MY REGION GAIN SPECIALLY WHEN OBASANJO WAS PRESIDENT FOR EIGHT YEARS? As for Osibajo, I commend Luke 12 verse 17-21 to him: 17. He thought to himself, “What shall I do? I have no place to store my crops.”
18. “Then he said: “This is what I’ll do. I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods.
19. And I’ll say to myself, “You have plenty of good things laid up for many years. Take life easy; eat, drink and be merry.”
20. “But God said to him, “You fool! This very night your life will be demanded from you. Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?” Source: Facebook
