By Adewumi Bukola Abuja –   In the spirit of Christmas, hundreds of fun seekers in Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on Wednesday besieged the Millennium Park in Abuja to continue with the celebration of the Christmas season. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that people of all ages were seen catching fun with their friends and love ones, entertaining themselves with music, foods and drinks. Mr Solomon Ayakut, one of the fun seekers said the holiday was a moment to spend time with family and friends. ”I have been to this place on several occasions and I must confess, it is getting better over time. ”The environment is very clean and well organised, am happy am here with my family,” he said. Mr Adedoyin Adeshina described the Christmas break as a time to relax and take off the stress of work. ”I was looking forward to the break so I can get deserved rest from the stress of work. ”Coming to the park with my friends is perfect for me to appreciate nature and the environment. It’s so good for the soul,” he said. Meat seller, Malam Abdul Yakubu, described the season as a good time for business. ”I have made good money at the park since the beginning of the Christmas season. It’s a place to do business at a season like this,” he said. One of the workers at the park, who pleaded anonymity, said that the park had been attracting hundreds of fun seekers daily. ”The large turnout of people who come daily, some to relax some for birthdays and meeting, is a daily occurrence,” he said. Mrs Sharon Edmond, a mother of four, said she brought her kids to relax and play. She, however, called on the park authority to improve security to discourage miscreants from coming to into the facility. ”As we were sitting and having fun some took my bag away before I could notice,” she said.
