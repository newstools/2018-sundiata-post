President Muhammadu Buhari, in Krakow, Poland declares: “It’s real me, I assure you. I will soon celebrate my 76th birthday and I will still go strong.’’ With all modesty, I ought take credit for advising the Presidency (in my essay: Buhari and the Jubrin Mystery) to get Buhari to say what he reportedly said in Krakow. I had argued that this will help to douse the impact of the Jubrin doppelgänger rumour. At least the Presidency listened. However, I believe it would have been more effective if the President had made the declaration back home, talking directly to the people. He also needs to l be open about his illness. Tell the people what ails him, for which millions of pounds of tax payers money was spent to get him back to good health. He is human and in his 70s for crying out loud. What’s there to hide about an ailment? President Buhari, please do the needful and spare the nation, needless rumours. Source: Facebook
