 Abuja(SundiataPost)- Mr Adetola Olubajo, the President, Nigerian Union in South Africa, on Wednesday urged members to put smile on the faces of less privileged during the festive season. Adetola made the appeal at a Christmas party held for the less privileged children at Muldesdrift in Johannesburg, South Africa on Tuesday night. He said that the party organised by the union’s national leaders and its women league, donated gifts to 81 children aged between one and 15. “I wish to encourage the Nigerian community to put smile on the faces of less privileged among us during the festive season. “Nigerians are also advised to enjoy the season responsibly and need not flaunt their wealth unnecessarily,’’ he said in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt. He also advised Nigerians to be law abiding and resist committing acts that could harm them or tarnish the image of the country. Contributing, the Leader of the union’s Women Wing, Mrs Chidilim Chukwuma, thanked the leadership of the Nigerian community for assisting the less privileged in South Africa. “May God bless our efforts to change the negative narratives about Nigerians in South Africa,’’ she prayed. She said that in 2017, the Christmas party for the less privileged kids was held in Sandton. Sandton is an affluent area situated in the Johannesburg Municipality, Gauteng, South Africa. The name comes from the combination of two of its suburbs, Sandown and Bryanston. “The union transported children from different locations to Sandton, the venue of the party and it was a memorable day. “We will organise another party for the less privileged children in 2019 at a new location,’’ she assured the people.
