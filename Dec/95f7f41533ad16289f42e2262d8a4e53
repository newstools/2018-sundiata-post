Beyonce caused South Africa to stand still last night with her heavenly voice. The singer took to her website to pen a heartfelt letter to the late Nelson Mandela after the group Global Citizen The Global Citizen aims to end extreme poverty in the world by 2030. The other artists featured on the album are Pharrell, David Guetta, and Cassper Nyovest. And the 4-track EP, which will be released on Friday, November 30, is curated by Coldplay‘s Chris Martin. The songs are inspired by Nelson Mandela’s fight for racial equality, and the proceeds from the EP will go to the fight for gender equality, education, clean water, and more. And yesterday, she mounted the stage with her husband to perform their old and new songs.  (OLISHA TV)
