By Deborah Coker Auchi (Edo) –   The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo on Monday flagged off its campaign with a charge to defectors to the party to partner and effect a change in the country. The Chairman of the party in the state, Chief Dan Orbih, who addressed the new defectors in Auchi, expressed delight at the turnout. He said the party was stronger than ever before in the state and called for the enthronement of a PDP leadership in the country in 2019. Mr Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the party’s governorship candidate in the 2016 Edo governorship election, prayed God to take control of the country. He expressed optimism that God would ensure that the PDP wins the forthcoming general elections. Mr Abubakar Momoh, the Edo North Senatorial candidate of the party, also appealed to party loyalists to avoid the mistakes of the past. He further urged the party members to defend their votes. NAN reports that the defectors included Mr Joshua Oni, APC Party Leader for Owan East Local Government and Owan West Local Government, and Alhaji Abduhrama Momoh, a former council chairman in Owan East Local Government Council.
