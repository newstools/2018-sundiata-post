Former Manchester United midfielder, Michael Carrick has been appointed to takeover as caretaker boss at the club. This is following the sack of Jose Mourinho on Tuesday. The club slumped to a 3-1 defeat at arch-rivals Liverpool on Sunday and left them a whopping 19 points adrift of the Premier League table toppers. Reports emerging from Old Trafford said that the club has appointed Carrick as caretaker boss until a permanent replacement is made. The 37-year-old former England international resigned from playing football last summer, and despite being just a matter of months into his new role at United, has made himself popular with the club’s players, who enjoy a good rapport with their former teammate. A former Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane and Mauricio Pochettino are leading candidates to take the position permanently. United would to pay Mourinho, who was sacked on Tuesday after a 3-1 loss to Liverpool, a staggering £24million in compensation. A source at Old Trafford told Sky Sport, “Michael Carrick will be acting as interim manager of Manchester United until a new temporary manager is appointed – an external appointment is expected within 48 hours. Carrick and Kieran McKenna will continue to take training in the meantime. “ Source:Dailypost
