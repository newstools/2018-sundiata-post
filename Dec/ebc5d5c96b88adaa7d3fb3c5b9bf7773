Washington, Dec. 13, 2018 (dpa/NAN) The United States will re-evaluate its financial support for humanitarian aid, economic boosters and peacekeeping missions in Africa as the country seeks to counter China and Islamist extremists. The National Security Advisor John Bolton said this on Thursday. “Billions upon billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars have not achieved the desired effects. They have not stopped the scourge of terrorism, radicalism and violence,’’ Bolton said in Washington, unveiling President Donald Trump’s new Africa policy. Bolton, who is known for his hawkish foreign-policy style, said China and Russia were quickly gaining footholds in Africa and accused Beijing of employing “bribes, opaque agreements and the strategic use of debt’’ to control African states. He noted China’s military base expansion on the continent and Russian arm sales. He vowed that the U.S. would not give a blank cheque to dictators and that it will also “no longer support unproductive, unsuccessful and unaccountable UN peacekeeping missions.’’ He was critical of corruption and “payouts’’ to countries who provide soldiers for peacekeeping without protecting populations in need. In particular, he said there would be a review of aid to South Sudan, a country mired in conflict. He said aid would come coupled with responsibilities. “Our objective is to resolve conflicts, not freeze them in perpetuity,’’ Bolton insisted. On the diplomatic front, Bolton warned that countries voting against the U.S. at international forums will “not receive generous American foreign aid.’’ “Every dollar of aid we spend will further U.S. priorities in the region,’’ Bolton said, adding that economic aid will help African growth and independence but also look to’’ support American jobs and expand market access for U.S. exports.’’ (dpa/NAN)
