By Hilary Akalugwu  Nsukka     –        Mr Christopher Ezema, Deputy Controller, Nsukka Prisons, Enugu State, on Tuesday called for help from the public to enable the inmates to acquire skills. Ezema who made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Nsukka, said such skills would make the inmate useful and self-reliant at the end of their jail terms. The deputy controller spoke at the ongoing Nsukka 2018 Trade Fair. “Nsukka Prisons authorities want to ensure that inmates leave the prison as better citizens by empowering them with one skill or the other. “We are appealing to philanthropists and the public to assist the authorities by donating money and materials that would help the inmates acquire skills. “If they acquire skills, they will be useful to themselves and the society and it will make majority of them not to engage in crime that will return them to the prison,” he said. The deputy controller said Nsukka Prisons was at the trade fair to showcase the beautiful cane chairs, centre tables, side stools, clocks, mirrors and others goods produced by the inmates in the Carpentry Department. “In Nsukka prisons, we have the carpentry, barbing, shoe-making, tailoring and electrical departments, among others,” he said. Ezema said days were gone when inmates idled away their time while serving their prison terms, adding that prisons were no longer places for punishment, but reformatory centres. “Now they are trained on one skill or the other so that they will become useful citizens when they finish their prison terms. “We have a plan to help them buy some tools and equipment to enable them to start what they have learnt after leaving prison. “I urge all visitors and participants in the trade fair to visit and patronise us at the Enugu State pavilion,” he said
