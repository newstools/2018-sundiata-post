By Yemi Adeleye  Lagos   –      A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Chief Stanley Osifo, has urged INEC to make the 2019 General Elections the best so far. Osifo said on Wednesday in Lagos that INEC’s neutrality in the polls would go along way to make the outcome acceptable. The presidential aspirant spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He also advised politicians to see elections as a public service and not a do-or-die affair. According to the politician, INEC must ensure that election results are not manipulated in favour of any party, in an effort to deepen democracy. “Politicians must take it easy; election is not a do-or-die affair; INEC must make the elections the best it ever conducted. “The commission must ensure the elections are free and fair,” he said. Osifo expressed sadness that some Nigerians had given up hope on the country. He told NAN that there was still hope for the country, urging the citizens to change the perception. According to him, if Nigerians fail to change the perception, it will be difficult to change the negative narration in the country. “People believe that things cannot get better; I don’t believe so. We should join hands to make things better. There is hope; I believe in the Nigerian project; a lot of people don’t believe in Nigeria. They don’t know that things can change in the country,” Osifo said. Osifo said that if he had the opportunity to lead the country, he would focus on education for empowerment, healthcare to end medical tourism, security and agriculture to end hunger and poverty. On his assessment of the Muhammadu Buhari administration, the aspirant said that he would not say that the administration had not done well.
