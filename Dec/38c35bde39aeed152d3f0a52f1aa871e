By Solomon Asowata  Lagos –  The Commissioner for the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), Mr Akin Olateru, says the aviation sector has recorded no major air crash for over three years because of the synergy and effective collaboration among the agencies. Olateru made the assertion at the 47th Annual General Meeting of the Nigerian Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) in Lagos on Saturday. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that other agencies in the sector are the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency. Olateru emphasised that agencies in the sector must continuously work together to sustain this feat. He said: “This year’s theme :’ Stronger Collaboration for Zero Air Accident’, stresses encouragement of smooth understanding between the important agencies in the aviation industry to work as one.” The AIB commissioner noted that the air traffic control service plays a crucial role in ensuring safety, aiding smooth and better communication between the pilots and the ground staff in order to avoid air accidents and incidents. He, therefore, implored all aviation stakeholders to work together and place premium on the development of human capacity which would in turn yield a positive level of productivity. Olateru also called for periodic review of policies and regulations to meet up with global standards on aviation safety. He used the occasion to highlight the achievements of the bureau in the last 23 months, which include the release of 21 final accident reports, 73 safety recommendations and also the first safety bulletin.
