By Emmanuel Acha  Enugu   –       The Enugu State Chapter of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has commended Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for approving the payment of 13th month salary for workers in the state in December. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the governor announced the approval of the payment while presenting the 2019 Appropriation Bill to the state House of Assembly. This is the second time during the tenure of Ugwuanyi that workers in the state will receive such gesture as the same payment was made in 2017. Mr Virginus Nwobodo, the state Chairman of NLC, told NAN on Tuesday in Enugu that the workers were elated by the announcement. Nwobodo said that the gesture, coming at a time most state governors could not pay salaries, was exceptional. “The governor promised to pay not just core civil servants, but workers in all government agencies. “We are very grateful and pray God to meet him at the point of his needs,” he said. The NUJ chairman promised that workers would not take the governor’s good gesture for granted, but would reciprocate it in due time. “We urge our members to reciprocate this gesture by being diligent and committed to their duties,” Nwobodo said.
