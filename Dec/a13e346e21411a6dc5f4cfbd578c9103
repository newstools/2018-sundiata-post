By Mercy Obojeghren  Asaba –  A body named Child Nutrition Advocacy Group has called for the revival of food and nutrition committee at the local government level in order to check child malnutrition and stunted growth. The group led by Mrs Millicent Amitaye, made the call when it paid a courtesy visit to the Chairman of Oshimili South Local Government Area, Mr Uche Osadebe, on Friday in Asaba. Child Nutrition Advocacy Group comprises nutritionists, officials from the Ministry of Economic Planning, National Orientation Agency and members of Civil Society Organisations. Amitaye, an Assistant Director in the Ministry of Economic Planning, noted that Delta was currently ranked poor by the United Nations International Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF) in child nutrition. The leader of the group, who said that nutrition committees were moribund in most local government areas, added that one in every five children in the state was stunted according to the UNICEF statistics. She explained that malnourished children were poorly positioned to compete academically and health wise with their counterparts, adding that the future of such children were not guaranteed. Amitaye said that the target of the group was to improve the nutrition of children between the ages zero and five as well as women within the reproductive age. She said that the group would achieve this through the “End Hunger” policy of the Federal and State Governments, adding that the effort would be complemented at the local government level. Responding, the council chairman, noted that child malnutrition would always be traced to the deplorable state of the economy of the nation. “In as much as I applaud this policy, there is also the need to tackle the present economic situation of the country,’’ he said. Osadebe assured the group of the readiness of Oshimili South local government to revive the committee as well as initiate health talks in various health centres within area. (NAN)
