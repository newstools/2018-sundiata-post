By Abubakar Ahme Gusau –   Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company (KAEDCO) says it loses over N200 million monthly in Zamfara due to illegal connections and customers’ refusal to settle their bills. The Business Development and Relationship Officer of the company in the state, Sabo Abdul, disclosed this in Gusau on Thursday at the Customer Engagement Session organised to sensitize customers on the operations of the company. Abdul said the company was generated about N100 million monthly as against N350 million from the state. “This meeting was organised to draw the attention of our customers on the need to be prompt in settling their bills for effective service delivery and economic growth. “Every month, after the state government pays its bills and followed by some of the promising companies and business owners, only about 40 per cent of our regular individual customers help to make us generate up to a hundred plus; so we always run at a deficit,” he said. He said that very soon the management would be accompanying field officers to identify those involved in illegal connections for them to be removed from the grid. The officer, who commended the participants for attending the forum, said it would be organised regularly to give customers the opportunity to raise issues concerning electricity supply to guarantee efficiency in service delivery and payments. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that speakers at the meeting urged officials of KAEDCO to be more professional in their conduct and promised to partner with the company to disconnect illegal connections (NAN)
