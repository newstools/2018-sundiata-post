 The document read in part: “The dominant constraint on December 14, 2018 was due to unavailability of gas – constraining a total of 2,791.5mw from being available on the grid.” For the day under the review, average energy sent out was 4,128 mw/hour (up by 23.52mw/hour from the previous day). Also, 175mw was not generated due to high frequency resulting from unavailability of distribution infrastructure while zero megawatt was not generated due to unavailability of transmission infrastructure. Nil was recorded as losses due to water management. (Guardian).
