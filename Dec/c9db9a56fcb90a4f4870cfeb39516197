By Christian Njoku Calabar –  Gov. Ben Ayade of Cross River has said that the 2018 Carnival Calabar was a platform to showcase Africa to the world. Ayade said this at the flag off of the Carnival Calabar on Friday in Calabar. The governor, who said Cross River was hosting the whole world, added that the theme of the carnival “Africanism” goes beyond Africa. “With the theme Africanism, Africa has the opportunity of telling the whole world its story the way it knows best which is through its dance and bright colours.” According to Ayade, Africanism is a message to the world to conduct and think Africa because Africa is about love, beauty and character. “Civilisation started in Africa, so Africa must take its pride of place in the world. “We are also here to show that Africa as a continent is the future, Europe is the past while Asia was the present,” he said. Earlier, Chairman of the Carnival Commission, Gab Unah said Cross River has so much love to share with the rest of the world. He urged participants and tourists to enjoy the carnival and the hospitality the state offers.
