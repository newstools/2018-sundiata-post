By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has felicitated with Christians as they mark the birth of Christ tomorrow even as he also charged Nigerians to use the occasion of this year’s Christmas to offer special prayers for good leaders with love of the people to emerge. According to him, “We need political leaders that can bring smiles on the faces of the people and such leaders can only come from God through our sincere supplications. Prince Secondus said in a Christmas message to Nigerians that they should use this period to seek God’s mercy so he can provide leaders that will bring comfort and peace in the country. In a statement from his media office signed by media Adviser Ike Abonyi, Prince Secondus notes that 2019 general election provides the people the ample opportunity to rescue not just our democracy but the country but our desire can only be met by God whom we must use this Yuletide to cry to for his grace. The National Chairman then said that as Christmas marks the birthday anniversary of our lord and savior, Jesus Christ, there is no better time to seek God’s intervention to send a leader who would save this country than this period. “Yuletide time like this is therefore very auspicious for Nigerians to bury their political, ethnic and religious differences and go on their knees to seek God’s face in the country’s challenges. “The indignation in our faces across board shows it all that the people are sad and disappointed; let us therefore pray for a peaceful election to usher in joy in the land. Prince Secondus urged Christians to use the reason for this season to show love to one another and build on those things that unite rather than what divides us. Finally, the National Chairman, on behalf of the leadership and members of our great party wish all Nigerians joyful and trouble free Christmas celebrations.
