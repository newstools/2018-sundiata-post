Abuja(SundiataPost)-Retirees under the aegis of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners Contributory Pension Scheme Sector (NUPCPS) have written to President Muhammadu Buhari, applauding his administration as the best in 14 years of the pension scheme. In a letter dated Dec. 10 and signed by the Chairman of the union, Sylva Nwaiwu, the pensioners said they were registering their “unanimous acknowledgment and commendation of the good performance” of the administration. A statement issued in Abuja on Friday by the president’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, said the pensioners particularly lauded the Federal Government’s Contributory Pension Scheme sector as well as the Nigerian pension industry in general. The union, according to the statement, said the consensus was reached during the union’s 3rd Post-inaugural Congress/Interactive Session with the National Pension Commission (PENCOM) held last month in Abuja. While distancing itself from partisan politicking, NUPCPS said the union was made of “elder statesmen and women who must stand for the truth, no matter whose ox is gored, we owe no one an apology for expressing the truth we know about the good works of your administration. “Your administration inherited huge pension liabilities as a result of the excesses and recklessness of the previous administration which mismanaged pension funds meant for the payment of retirement benefit, nevertheless, your contribution in just a few years in office is one of the best we have seen in the 14 years of the existence of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) in our nation. “Your insight, determination, political will and commitment as demonstrated in the release of bailout funds to ameliorate the sufferings of Nigerian workers/pensioners is unequaled and highly appreciated by the union and other stakeholders,’’ the union said. It also urged the president to “complete the good work you have started” by authorising additional bailout to clear the outstanding backlog from last year.
