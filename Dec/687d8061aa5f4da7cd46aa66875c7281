You refuse to release funds to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) to enable it compute and release the 2018 jobs/unemployment report because you fear that the report will further embarrass your administration when it shows more job losses and an increase in the unemployment numbers. Yet you have the gumption to direct the same NBS to revise its unemployment figures, in other words, to abandon the methodology it has used since its existence to compute unemployment numbers because the numbers show that you’re a terrible economic manager who has hemorrhaged millions of jobs in the last three years. You even lie on the Statistician-General of the Federation that he admitted to the creation of millions of phantom agricultural jobs to the FEC. The man comes out to categorically deny that he ever made such a presentation or admission before the FEC as claimed. Instead of apologizing to the man and knowing when to stop digging, since you’re already in a self-created hole, you say the man should organize a world press conference to talk about the said bogus 12 million jobs purportedly created in agriculture. Is this a form of blackmail–cook up and release through a world press conference unemployment numbers favorable to us or your money will not be released? What a joke of a presidency. It would be funny if the consequences of this incompetence and deception weren’t tragic. Source: Facebook
