Abuja(SundiataPost) –No fewer than 4,000 children living in the riverine areas in Benue will be dewormed by a political support group, “Samuel Ortom Re-election Actualisation Initiative’’. The Leader of the group, Mr Abel Ochai, made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi on Wednesday. According to him, a survey carried out by the organisation’s team of medical personnel shows that many communities in the riverine areas suffer from river-borne diseases which due to lack of medical attention can lead to death. He lauded the large number of people that turned up to partake in the exercise, which he noted were not based on party affiliation. Ochai explained that the exercise which began in Wadata, a riverine community in Makurdi, would extend to Buruku, Katsina Ala and all other communities along the river banks in Benue. He advised the people, especially those living in the riverine areas to make themselves available to be dewormed when the team visits. “We have our medical experts and the vaccines will be administered to children from two to 18 years of age,’’ Ochai said. A volunteer with the group, Mr Kenkeng Ati, who helped in administering the drugs, said they noticed that Wadata area in Makurdi and Buruku markets area had more kids de-wormed. Ati noted that the communities were prone to worms due to their proximity to the river. He commended the people of Buruku community for their large turnout and promised a repeat of the exercise in the area soon, so that more people could be dewormed. In their response, some beneficiaries of the programme, Denis Ahamgba and Mike Tyonum, thanked the group for bringing such a health programme to their doorsteps. They, therefore, appealed to the government to support the group to cover a larger population. (NAN)
