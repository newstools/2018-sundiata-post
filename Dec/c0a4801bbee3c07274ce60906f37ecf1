By Ruth Oketunde Abuja –   The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) on Tuesday commended Federal Government’s decision to reduce the cost of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) and National Examination Council (NECO) forms.
The group gave the commendation in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja.
The statement signed by the organisation’s Chairman, Mr Niyi Akinsiju, and Secretary, Mr Cassidy Madueke, described the decision as a dividend of President Muhammadu Buhari’s anti-corruption war.
“It is another proof of the President’s interest in the welfare of all Nigerians regardless of economic status.
“Under President Muhammadu Buhari, JAMB has seen a significant increase in remittances from N60 million in 2010 to over N15 billion in 2017 and 2018.
“We are happy that the President has directed the Ministry of Education to look into demands for reduction of examination fee following the improvement in revenues remitted to the Treasury by the Education Agencies.
“After blocking the leakages in JAMB remittances, the monies saved are now redistributed to Nigerian parents via the reduction in forms from N5,000 to N3,500 and N11,350 to N9,850 for NECO,” the statement reads.
The organisation added that the reduction in the sale of the forms will translate to increased application to universities in the coming years. (NAN)
