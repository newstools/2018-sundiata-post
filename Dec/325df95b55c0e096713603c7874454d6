“only a fool will sit on the fence or be neutral when his or her country is being destroyed with incompetence, corruption, lack of focus, insecurity, nepotism, brazen impunity and denial of the obvious.” —Olusegun Obasanjo, December 9, 2018 (debunking the false report that he had become neutral on 2019) My sympathies to Buharists. Their weekend relief stemming from the fake news that Obasanjo had reverted to a neutral position regarding 2019 is replaced by an emphatic reiteration of the former president’s endorsement of Atiku and his concomitant condemnation of the disaster that is Buhari’s presidency.
