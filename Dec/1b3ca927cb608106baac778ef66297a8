The agency’s Commander in the state, Mrs Sylvia Egwunwoke, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna of Tuesday that the suspected was nabbed in Makwa, Makwa Local Government Area of the state. She said that the drug was concealed in a Toyota Camry car with registration number KWL 874 FH at Makwa town. She said that the suspect was stopped at Jebba check point but refused to stop. “Our personnel, unknown to him were following him and was arrested where he stopped to eat at Makwa town,’’ Egwunwoke said. She said that the suspect would be charged to court after investigation. The commander appealed to the state government to provide patrol vehicles to pave way for the arrest of all those involved in illegal trades. “The interception of these concealment have in no small measure prevented the risk of having such large quantity of this deadly substance in circulation in our midst,” she said.
