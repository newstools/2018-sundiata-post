By Edeki Igafe  Warri   –        Aproko.com Initiative, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), says President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to withhold assent on the Electoral Act Amendment Bill does not mean that he wanted to subvert the will of the people.
Executive Director of the NGO, Mr Justin Amaechi, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Warri on Monday that he was optimistic that the All Progressive Congress (APC) led-administration would conduct credible election in 2019.
He, however, said that it would have been better if Buhari had assented to the bill.
Amaechi said it was still possible for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to rely on the existing Electoral Act to conduct the election and still achieve free and fair exercise.
“I disagree with the rumour that President wants to return to power by all means in the 2019 election.
“His refusal to assent to the amendment bill does not mean he wanted to subvert the will of the people. The election is near.
“However, we think that it will have been better if he had assented to the amendment bill that is generally accepted as representative of the will of the people,” he said.
Amaechi said what the country needed is for INEC and security agencies to remain neutral in the conduct of the election.
“I do not have issues with the Electoral Act but INEC the electoral umpire and the security agencies should not be biased,” he said.
