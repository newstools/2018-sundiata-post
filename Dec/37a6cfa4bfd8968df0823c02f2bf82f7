By Leonard Okachie  Umuahia,   –     Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia on Wednesday advised all employers to desist from the habit of rejecting members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) posted to them.
He said the negative effect such rejection had on the psyche of corps members and the scheme was enormous.
The governor, who was represented by Mr. Ike Anyatonwu, Commissioner for Youth Development, gave the advice at the closing ceremony of the orientation course for 2018 Batch “C” Stream II corps members deployed to Abia.
Ikpeazu urged the employers to rather adjust their budgets to accommodate the financial implication that might be required to fully absorb them.
He described corps members as vibrant, creative and energetic young Nigerians who were poised to render free service to the state and the nation.
The governor said the skills acquisition and entrepreneurship development (SAED) programme was a step in the right direction.
“I encourage you to improve on the skills you have learnt while on camp and also apply same in your host communities,” he told corps members.
In her address, Mrs Francesca Ifon, the State Coordinator, NYSC, urged the local government councils to involve corps members in the execution of their community based development programmes.
Ifon also called on various government and non-governmental agencies to identify projects for the corps members who would act as catalyst to mobilise communities towards executing the projects so identified.
“Corps members have done this in the past and will always do more if properly directed, motivated and challenged,” she said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a total of 1,621 corps members participated in the orientation course.
