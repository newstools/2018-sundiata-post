Michelle’s husband, Barack Obama, also holds the distinction of being the most admired man, with 19 per cent naming him for this category, making him to now hold the title for 11 consecutive years. If he is named again in 2019, he will tie another former president, Dwight Eisenhower, who holds the record for the highest number of years named most admired man. President Donald Trump came in second place with 13 per cent naming him, as 35 per cent of Democrats named Barack Obama while 32 per cent of Republicans named Trump as the most admired man. George W.
