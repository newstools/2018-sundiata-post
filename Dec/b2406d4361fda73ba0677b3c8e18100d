By Stanley Nwanosike  Enugu    –         The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) says it is optimistic that recent increase in the salaries of police personnel by the Federal Government would help check corruption in the organisation.
NANS National Public Relations’ Officer, Mr Bestman Okereafor, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Monday that the move was in the right direction.
He, however, urged the federal government to look at the possibility of insurance cover for police personnel against accidents and sudden death especially those in special units and formations that work on the field day and night.
According to him, no benefit is too much to be given to these gallant officers especially those who carry out their duties with sincerity and dedication.
“NANS wishes to specially commend the federal government especially President Muhammadu Buhari over the decision to upwardly review the monthly salaries of police personnel.
“NANS considers this as a progressive step.
“We have no doubt that the increase in wage will further enhance commitment and dedication in the force.
“NANS is also optimistic that the move will greatly reduce corruption and bribery in the organisation in-line with Buhari’s anti-corruption campaign,’’ he said.
