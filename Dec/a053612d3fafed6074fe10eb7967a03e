I was watching a South African soccer league match last night when I started dozing off. I don’t punish myself when nature calls: I always obey! Exactly 7:50pm last night, I took my phones, left the living room and went to sleep. “Tunde, put off the gen by 10pm,” I told the guy who stays with me. Woke up exactly 12:41am and I knew I won’t be able to sleep again. After checking WhatsApp messages, I veered to Facebook and that was it: posts upon posts, comments upon comments over the Vice-Presidential debate. Depending on which side of the political divide you belong to, your assessment is about how “poor” the other party was and how “good” your own man was. Could Osibajo have been a total disaster? I doubt. Could Obi have been a complete hogwash? I don’t think so. But that is what I got. I think only one ‘reporter’ actually gave kudos to the two men. Unfortunately, for those who didn’t watch, it has been one hell of “information toss-around”. Depending on who was reporting and his or her political leaning. Hardly did anyone highlight where each debater did well and where he or she did not. It was just TWO EXTREMES. I always believe we can do better. Source: Facebook
