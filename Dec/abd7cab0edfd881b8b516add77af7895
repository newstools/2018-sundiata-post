Nigerians have reacted to the vice presidential debate held on Friday night on social media. Some of them on Twitter asked the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mr. Peter Obi, to also talk about the punishment meted out by China to its corrupt officials, not just its economic performance. Obi had said Nigeria lost four million jobs in a six-month period, while China created 10 million jobs. He said, “If you look at what China has been able to do with SMEs, SMEs in China is contributing to 60 per cent of their GDP. And 60 per cent of China’s GDP is 7.2tn (dollars), which is 18 per cent of Nigeria’s GDP. “China today, using the same SMEs, is guaranteeing 10 million jobs annually. Half of this year alone, China has produced 7.2 million jobs, which is over 40 per cent of their target. Within the same period, Nigeria lost four million jobs.” The debate which featured only five parties was organised by the Nigeria Elections Debate Group and the Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria. Also present were Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo of the All Progressives Congress, Khadija Abdullahi-Iya, the vice presidential candidate of the Alliance for New Nigeria, Ganiyu Galadima of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria and Umma Getso of the Young Progressives Congress. The debate was dominated, however, by Obi and Osinbajo. This was duly noted by social media users. See tweets: [[ Olalekan ]] #NextLevel

Since we like China so much, let us do what China does to people like PDP and be done with it once and for all. #Debate2019 Mustapha Maina Umar

Peter Obi is fond of reeling out statistics from the Chinese economy without telling us what China does to its corrupt officials. I think he was given the questions prior to the debate. He could not be having the statistics of other countries off head.#2019Debate#debate2019  “What is this obsession with China economy ? Will Obi and PDP be willing to do what China are doing to boost their economy ? Lock up all corrupt individuals? I doubt! #Debate2019 — Anie (@anipossa) December 14, 2018 Ada Campbell 👑

“#Debate2019 5. If the quality of the king is evident in the persons that he appoints, then we have a lot to worry about the capacities of the other three Presidential candidates. Their VPs were not fit to be on that stage tonight. The question now is are they?” Chijindu Itoroh
