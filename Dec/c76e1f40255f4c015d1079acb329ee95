By Nana Musa  Abuja –  Some residents in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), are taking advantage of Christmas  celebrations to hang out with family members and friends. The residents, who were having fun at the Millennium Park, Abuja on Tuesday, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that Nigerians, especially workers, should make out time, hang out and relax with loved ones. According to them, sit-outs and other forms of entertainment, should be more often and not only during festive periods. One of the fun seekers, Mr John Alhassan, said Christmas Day was the birth of Jesus Christ and it should be celebrated well as a season of love. “It was a difficult year, full of expectations which has not been achieved but thank God for all his mercies” “I am happy there was no fuel scarcity this year which means the government is working,” Alhassan said. Another fun seeker, Mrs Favour Ogbona, said Jesus Christ’s birth brought joy, happiness and everything good, she advised  people to hang out. “I am happy at the turn up of people and some people are yet to come.” “Having fun also helps our kids to be educationally, morally and socially sound and should not be encouraged only during festivities,” she said. Ogbona also urged the government to provide more facilities in the park, as it would boost patronage. NAN recalls that the patronage is high, compared to last year. Kid fun seeker Isaac Emmanuel, said he was happy going out on a day like this and urged others to tell their parents to take them out. “Fun centres are not only meant for kids, parents can also use the opportunity to ease stress and bond with families,” he said. Emmanuel said having fun in places such as the Millennium Park would help promote peace and unity in country. (NAN)
