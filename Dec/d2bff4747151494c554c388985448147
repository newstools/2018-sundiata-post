Abuja(SundiataPost)- The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) are working closely to reduce crime in Edo before, during and after the yuletide. The Benin Sector Commander of FRSC, Mr Anthony Oko, made the disclosure in Benin on Thursday when he paid a working visit to Mr Buba Wakawa, the NDLEA’s State Commander. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the meeting was to perfect collaborative measures aimed at reducing carnage on roads especially during the festivities. Oko noted that most drivers got involved in road accidents due to their involvement in drugs. He also said that a sustained working relationship with the NDLEA would ensure people’s safety on the nation’s highways. ‘‘The strategic partnership of stakeholders shall be maximally explored in reducing accidents and enhancing safety of roads. ‘‘My visit is to build on the cordial working relationship in our quest for excellence,’’ he said. Responding, Wakawa said that the longstanding synergy between both agencies would be pursued with greater vigour. ‘‘This visit at this time of the year underscores the importance of our partnership. ‘‘The highways are of great interest to us because of the movement of drugs from one point to another. ‘‘Our areas of cooperation cover training, intelligence sharing and joint operations,’’ he stated. NAN reports that the FRSC boss was conducted round the premises where he inspected seized drugs and vehicles and various modes of drug concealment. The NDLEA commander was accompanied by Mr Peter Ogar, Assistant Commander Operations and Intelligence; Mr Sule Usman, Assistant Commander Administration and Logistics as well as other principal officers of the command.
