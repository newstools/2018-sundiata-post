Abuja(SundiataPost) –A former member of the House of Representatives, Mr Patrick Obahiagbon, on Sunday night urged increased investment in the entertainment industry as a strategy to address youth restiveness. Obahiagbon, the All Progressives Congress Candidate for Edo South Senatorial District for the 2019 elections, made the call in Benin at the Annual Edo Entertainment Recognition Award. He said that although the industry had recorded tremendous growth over the years, its potentiality had, however, yet to be fully explored. Obahiagbon, one of  the award recipients, said that more investment in the industry would take off joblessness from thousands of youths through creation job opportunities. He said that governments should support the industry more and encourage private investment. “We have a big industry that is yet to be fully tapped into; our governments must begin to have renewed interests in the sector by investing in it. “With the right investment, the industry is not only capable of creating millions of jobs, it will also be an avenue for generating more revenues for governments. “It may also interest us to know that the sector can boost the tourism. It is a huge industry, and we must begin to see it from that perspective,” he said. According to the organiser of the event, Mr Daniel Eromosele, an aide to former Gov. Adams Oshiomhole, the award was to recognise individuals and corporate organisations who had contributed to the growth of the industry in Edo. (NAN)
