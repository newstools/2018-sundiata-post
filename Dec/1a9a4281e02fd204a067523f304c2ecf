By Oluyinka Fadare  Lagos   –     An author, Mrs Bukkie Yoloye, has urged Nigerians to put their trust in God, as they go to make their choices of the nation’s leaders in 2019. Yoloye told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lagos that there was no better place to start trusting in the Lord than in the choice of leaders in the country’s forthcoming elections. “If we trust in the Lord in the choices we make and the things we do, things will work better. “Acknowledging God in our leadership choices will be a turning point for Nigerians generally, and the nation as a whole. “There is the tendency for people to judge by facial expressions, appearances and utterances. “However, if we cease from talking and judging people by their qualifications or the experience they have but by what God thinks, we will definitely make better choices,” she said. According to Yoloye, there is more to life than what we see or have presently; so, Nigerians, especially the youth, should not be moved by what they see and the desire to have what the world has to offer. On her book, ‘The Blessed Holy Spirit,” Yoloye said it was an outflow of 25 years of walking with God. She said it was not her first book, but the first one she launched publicly. The author said she shared her rich encounter with the Holy Spirit in the book, which was meant to encourage Christians into deeper, richer and more fulfilling walk with their maker. In the book, Yoloye said that there was no better time to get to know the personality of the Holy Spirit to get seemingly elusive and long-searched for answers. Quoting from the Bible, she stressed that the Holy Spirit could give life to any needy person, as He had come to give us life and to give it more abundantly. NAN reports that the nine-chapter book was launched in Lagos on Saturday.
