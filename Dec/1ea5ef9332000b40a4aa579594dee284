By Fortune Abang Abuja –  Israel said on Thursday that it would not relent in its efforts to defend the operation to protect Israeli citizens and the sovereignty of the nation. Ms Zanswat Bowsan, Press Officer of the Embassy of Israel in Nigeria, made this known in a statement, issued to newsmen in Abuja. It said that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) had launched an operation to locate and neutralise cross-border assault tunnels that penetrated Israeli territory from Lebanon. The statement described the tunnels as having been built by the internationally designated terror organisation, Hezbollah. “The tunnels were constructed by Hezbollah and funded by Iran-alongside the ongoing efforts to transfer arms, convert inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles and manufacture precision-guided missiles in Lebanon. “It is a flagrant violation of Israel’s sovereignty and marks yet another stage of Hezbollah’s ongoing effort to expand its military build-up and further destabilise the already volatile region. “Hezbollah, the Iranian proxy in Lebanon, is advancing an Iranian agenda to turn Lebanon into launching pad for attacks that threaten lives of innocent Israelis, while endangering Lebanon and its citizens. “The tunnel project constitutes an ongoing blatant violation of Security Council Resolutions and the State of Israel holds the Government of Lebanon responsible for these violations. “Israel is not interested in any escalation, it will take all necessary measures to defend its sovereignty and its citizens,” the statement said. It, however, said Israel had put measures to conduct defensive engineering in the South of Blue Line in Israeli territory, to neutralize the cross border assault tunnels emanating from Lebanese territory.
