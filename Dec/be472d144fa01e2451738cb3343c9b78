By Muhammad Auwal   Yola    –      The North East Commodity Association (NECAS), in collaboration with the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Adamawa chapter, has supported about 50,000 rice farmers in the North East. The Chairman of RIFAN in Adamawa, Mr Stephen Maduwa, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Yola on Thursday. Maduwa said that the farmers were assisted with various agricultural supplements that included high yield variety seedlings, fertilisers and herbicides. “Over 50,000 rice farmers from six states in the north east were supported with different agricultural supplements by NECAS in collaboration with RIFAN. “The gesture is to bring succor to the farmers who suffered much and are now recuperating from Boko Haram insurgency,” Maduwa said. He said that the association had also distributed 40 vehicles and over 300 motorcycles to agricultural supervisors and extension workers in Adamawa and Gombe States. Maduwa appealed to the Federal Government to assist RIFAN members who suffered heavy losses during the flood disaster which adversely affected rice production in the state. “Many of the rice farmers obtained agricultural loans from the Central Bank of Nigeria. Due to the flood experienced, the farmers will find it difficult to pay back the loan. “We hope the federal and state Ministry of Agriculture would intervene in the payment of the loan,” Maduwa said.
