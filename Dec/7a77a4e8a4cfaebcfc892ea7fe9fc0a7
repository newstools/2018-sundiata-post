By Simon Akoje  Lagos   –    An energy expert, Mr Yemi Kolawole has appealed to the Federal Government to grant tax rebates to operators of alternative energy in order to promote growth. Kolawole, the Chief Executive Officer, Topian Energy Solutions gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Thursday. He pointed out that incentives in form of tax rebates were critical in promoting alternative energy in order to bridge the power gap. “To enable alternative energy to grow, about ten years tax break should be issued to operators “With such incentives in place, most of the energy firms will be able to grow organically with fewer huddles. “A bill in place will clearly create the distinctions because alternative energy is renewable energy. “It is a clean form of energy and suitable for the climate, especially now that there is sudden rise in global warming,’’ he said.
