Liverpool (UK) –   Roberto Firmino struck a hat-trick as rampant Liverpool opened up a nine-point lead at the top of the English Premier League after crushing Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield on Saturday. Arsenal stunned the home crowd by taking the lead in the 11th minute. Ainsley Maitland-Niles scoring his first league goal for the club as he connected at the back post with an Alex Iwobi cross. It was the first time Juergen Klopp’s side had trailed at home since Dec. 30 of 2017, but just three minutes later they were back on level terms. Mohamed Salah jinked into the box and went down under a challenge but the ball fell to Firmino who made no mistake with a cheeky “no look’’ finish. Firmino then showed his full range of skills with a brilliant solo goal as he dribbled past three Arsenal defenders before slotting home with his left foot. Sadio Mane made it 3-1, converting a low Salah cross after a brilliant cross-field pass from Andy Robertson. And then on the stroke of halftime Salah made it 4-1 from the spot after he had been brought down in the box. Firmino completed his hat-trick, from the penalty kick spot, driving home in front of the Kop after Sead Kolasinac was ruled to have pushed over Dejan Lovren. Liverpool are nine points clear of second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who lost 3-1 at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Third-place Manchester City, who are 10 points behind Liverpool, can close the gap if they beat Southampton on Sunday.  (Reuters/NAN)
