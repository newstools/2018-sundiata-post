By Stanley Nwanosike  Enugu –   The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) on Saturday urged the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to go back to negotiations with the Federal Government. NANS was reacting to a statement reportedly issued by ASUU where it threatened not to honour any further invitation for a meeting with the Federal Government. “There is need for ASUU to continue its negotiations with the Federal Government to find a common ground to resolve issues that led to the union’s ongoing strike,’’ NANS National Public Relations Officer, Mr Bestman Okereafor, said. Okereafo, who made made this known in a statement issued to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu, said: “We consider this decision as devilish and not in the best interest of Nigerian students. “We wonder how the lingering disputes will be resolved if meetings are boycotted. “We are calling on the leadership of ASUU to reverse its decision and consider returning to the negotiation table.’’ The students’ umbrella body urged the lecturers to work towards resolving the dispute and suspend the strike before Jan. 1, 2019 in the interest of Nigerian students.
