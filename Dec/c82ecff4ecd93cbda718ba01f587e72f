By Ibrahim Kado  Akko     –      Gov. Ibrahim Dankwambo of Gombe State, has urged employers in the state to desist from rejecting corps members posted to their organisations for primary assignments. Dankwambo gave this advice on Wednesday at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Batch ‘C’ Stream II orientation course for National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members deployed to Gombe, Borno and Yobe. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Mr Charles Iliya, Dankwambo, said that employers had been implored to give corps members the same respect and treatment given to their staff. He said this gesture would boost the morale of corps members and enhance their sense of belonging. “In this regard, all corps members must make up their minds to give their best to their employers and host communities,” he said. He called on the corps members to adapt to the culture and traditions of their host communities. “Avoid indecent dressing, late night parties and more especially, avoid hate speeches,” he advised. In his remarks, the NYSC State Coordinator, Mr David Markson, lauded all stakeholders and corps members for their support and cooperation towards the success of the orientation course. He expressed happiness that corps members proved to be dedicated during their skill acquisition and entrepreneurship development programmes introduced by the Federal Government. Markson urged them to take the post camp training more seriously to enable them become masters of their trades as well as be on their own as job creators rather job seekers.
