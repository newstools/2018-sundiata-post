By Deborah Coker  Okada    –       Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo on Wednesday advised National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members in the State to avoid being used against the conduct of free and fair 2019 general elections. The governor gave the charge at the terminal parade/closing ceremony of the batch ‘C’ stream II, orientation course at Okada, near Benin. Obaseki, represented by Mr Mika Amanokhai, Commissioner, Youths and Special Duties, urged the corps members to also avoid acts that would threaten the unity and progress of the country. He said: “Dear compatriots, you are the batch that may be charged with the enormous duty of facilitating the conduct of the 2019 general elections. “I therefore challenge you to prepare your minds to perform the exercise with diligence and high sense of patriotic commitment to the country. “As umpires, avoid the temptation of doing those things that might threaten the smooth conduct of the elections or worst still the unity and progress of our country.” He gave an assurance that the government on its side would do everyone possible to guarantee the safety of the corps members in the discharge of their duties. According to the governor, it is on record that the state government rewards corps members who execute personal community development projects with honours. He said that the government would continue to create conducive atmosphere for them to showcase their innate talents and capabilities. Earlier, in his opening remarks, Mr Adebayo Ojo, State coordinator of the NYSC, said that the corps members, in the last three weeks in camp, had exhibited high level discipline, resilience, loyalty and commitment. Ojo said: “As managers of the scheme, the corps is satisfied and confident that the members have been fully equipped to render very important and rewarding services.’’ He, however, urged them to say no to all forms of negative behaviour and tendencies, as well as avoid unauthorised journeys.
