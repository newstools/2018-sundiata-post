The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has urged on Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari to terminate the appointment of his service chiefs over the recent killings in Zamfara State. Unknown gunmen attacked Birnin Magaji community in Tsafe Local Council Area, and Magami community in Faru District of Maradun Local Council Area of Zamfara State, killing several people over the weekend. PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, while condoling with the family of the victims, urged President Buhari to review his parade and make necessary changes in his security appointees. “The PDP has consistently told Mr President to review his parade. As the Commander-in-Chief, if his men in the front are being killed, he has the responsibility to review his parade, except if there is something underneath that he has not been able to explain to Nigerians,” Ologbodiyan said. “We sympathise with the families of the people that have been killed.” After the killings, Buhari disclosed plans to use the Armed Forces and other para-military agencies to tackle insurgency in Zamfara and Sokoto States. He promised to include the Police, Department of State Services and the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in the planned operation. The president also directed the Chief of Air Staff, Abubakar Sadiq to immediately proceed on an assessment trip to Zamfara and Sokoto States. Buhari then assured residents of other states affected by the insurgency that his administration remains committed to their safety. He said the horrendous acts of violence are crimes against humanity, adding that the violence must stop. But the PDP insists that Buhari’s assurances and a directive to the security heads were not enough. “PDP holds that, more than ever before, the time has come for Mr President to review his parade,” Ologbodinyan said.
