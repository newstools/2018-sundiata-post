ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Arguably two of the biggest female African music stars Yemi Alade and Tiwa Salvage, have taken the rivalry beyond music to something least expected — their buttocks. Yemi Alade started the fight when she took to her Twitter handle to throw shots at an unnamed person who according to her has been photoshopping her bum to deceive her fans on social media. She warned the person to stop deceing people and accept the fact that she has nothing behind. She wrote, “Stop increasing your ynash (buttocks) in your pictures. You know you are straight like ‘I’. Embrace your real self! Ahh ahh. Deceiving fans up and dan(down).”  However, Tiwa thought the message was directed at her and wasted no time to react. The Mavin First Lady first took to her Instagram Stories to write, “Don’t start a war you cannot finish. “Trust me I’m not the one. I’m quiet but don’t f**k with me.”  But it didn’t end there. She also took to her official Twitter account to say more.
