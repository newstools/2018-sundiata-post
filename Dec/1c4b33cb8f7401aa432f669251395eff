By Sunday John  Lafia   –        The Nasarawa State Board of Internal Revenue Service on Friday expressed its readiness to train 535 revenue officers on modern techniques, to boost the state’s finances. Mr Yakubu Mohammed, the Executive Chairman of the board, made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lafia. According to him, the exercise is aimed at building the capacity of the revenue collectors in order to boost the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) of the state. The chairman also said that the board would organise stakeholders meeting with revenue collection agencies in the state and authorities of Local Government Areas to sensitise them in order to avoid friction in revenue collection. “We will educate them on revenues that are supposed to be collected by the various levels of government. “All these measures are being taken as a result of the disagreement being encountered between the various agencies in the course of collecting revenue in the state,’’ Mohammed said. The chairman also said the board, under his watch, had digitalised the process of tax collection, using different electronic platforms to ease payment. He said the measures had helped in boosting the IGR of the state, thereby making it the leading one in the North Central states. Mohammed said that the state government had remitted all the outstanding of the 10 per cent IGR to the 13 LGAs as their share of generated revenue.
