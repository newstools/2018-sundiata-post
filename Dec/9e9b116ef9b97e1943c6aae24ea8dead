By Olusola Oke  Akure    –      The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) in Ondo State has called on the state government to convene a security summit to address the kidnap and killings in the state. The state’s NMA Chairman, Dr Olawale Oke, made the call on Monday in Akure at a press conference. The association had called the press conference to express its dissatisfaction with the security situation in the state following the kidnap of a pregnant doctor and two nurses by gunmen on the Akure-Owo Road on Thursday. “It is on this note that we are crying to the whole world that those that are carrying out their legitimate duties are no longer safe in Ondo State. “We, therefore, call on the Chief Security Officer of this state, Gov. Rotimi Akeredolu, to do the needful by paying more attention to the security of lives and property of the people in the state so that law-abiding citizens can be more productive. “There is an urgent need to call a real state security summit which will address the present situation as well as proffer general panacea to security,” he stated. Oke described the NMA as a noble association comprised of individuals fighting diligently for the health of the people in the state. The ability to carry out the duty, he said, was being threatened by criminals. “ They have made it a point of duty to subject us to psychological torture by kidnapping doctors and other health workers for ransom and in other cases gruesome murder of loyal citizens. “Within the spate of three months, three cases of kidnapping have been linked to doctors not to mention other health workers and other good citizens of this state. “This is becoming worrisome and highly unacceptable as our colleagues are now working under intense fear while getting to the work place is becoming an herculean task,” he said.
