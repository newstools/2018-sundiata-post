By Adekunle Williams and Solomon Asowata  Lagos    –       The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced global passenger traffic results for October showing that demand rose 6.3 per cent compared to the same month in 2017. The Geneva-based apex aviation body made the announcement on Thursday in a statement signed by its Director General, Mr Alexandre de Juniac which was posted on its website. de Juniac said this marked a rebound from 5.5 per cent growth recorded in September, which was an eight-month low. According to him, capacity also grew 6.3 per cent and load factor was flat at 81.1 per cent, matching last year’s record for the month. ”October’s healthy performance is reassuring after the slower demand growth in September, some of which was attributable to weather-related disruptions. ”However, the bigger picture is that traffic growth has moderated compared to earlier in the year, reflecting a more mixed economic backdrop and reduced demand stimulation from lower fares,” he said. The IATA boss said African airlines’ traffic grew 6.8 per cent year-on-year in October, raised from 6 per cent annual growth in September. He noted that the upward trend in passenger demand remained strong notwithstanding challenges in the economic backdrop of the continent’s largest economies, Nigeria and South Africa. According to him, capacity rose 5.5 per cent, and load factor climbed 0.9 percentage point to 70.3 per cent. de Juniac said airlines in all the regions recorded increase in demand during the period under review. He said: ”Demand for air travel is strong as we head into the holiday travel season. ”Trade wars and uncertainty around the political and economic impact of Brexit remain concerns but the recent easing of fuel prices is a welcome development.”
