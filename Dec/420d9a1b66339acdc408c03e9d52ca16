By Taiye Baiyerohi  Lagos   –      The Nigeria Hotel Association, on Tuesday, in Lagos, assured both local and international tourists of security in hotels across the nation during the yuletide. Mr Lanre Awoseyin, President of the association told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that hotel owners had guaranteed the security of their customers having ensured all security measures had been put in place. Awoseyin said that due to the security challenges in Nigeria which had discouraged tourists from visiting the country, the association had `deliberately’ channeled all effort to beef up security in hotels. According to him, most of the hotels have complied with the security measures spelt out by the association. “Hoteliers have been told to report criminal cases promptly to the nearest police station, install CCTV cameras at strategic locations within the hotel premises, register all guests before being lodged and monitor suspicious movement. He assured that the “hotels are fully prepared to accommodate local and international tourists, all security measures have been adopted to guarantee safety of lives and properties,” he said. ” They have also adopted some other international security measures which will not be disclosed. He said hoteliers who were not sensitive to security issues were fully aware of the consequences that would have on their businesses.
