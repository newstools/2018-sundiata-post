They want to distract us with the booing of the president by some legislators, a perfectly legitimate expression in a democracy, never mind that some APC legislators cheered the president and interrupted his budget speech with applause a few times. Ex-President Jonathan’s campaign convoy was pelted with stones and greeted with jeers and insults in Bauchi in 2015. In Kano and Katsina, a ritualized cleansing was performed, with the venues of Jonathan’s rally being washed and swept, after he had campaigned in those cities. Those who hailed those actions and praised the organizers are today zealous advocates of political decorum and respect for the office of the president. Hypocrisy is indeed Nigeria’s most endemic affliction. We will not be distracted from the unfolding economic disaster under Buhari. Yesterday, it was the NBS that gave us a snapshot of how the Buhari administration is a job hemorrhaging machine, with 3 million jobs lost in one year alone (2017-2018). Today, the Federation Accounts Allocation Committee (FAAC) has revealed that only $631 million is left in the Excess Crude Account (ECA). Only three weeks ago, the Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed, announced that the balance was $2.3 billion. This means that the administration of Mr. Integrity withdrew more than $1.6 billion from the account in three weeks. Put another way, the Buhari administration depleted the ECA by 73 percent in 3 weeks. Only Mr. Integrity, his minions, and God Almighty know why the account has been raided in such a hurried, brazen, and gargantuan manner. Source: Facebook
