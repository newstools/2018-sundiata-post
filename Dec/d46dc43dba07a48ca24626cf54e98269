By Idris Olukoya  Epe   –      Concerned Nigerians Group (CNG), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), has decried the large presence of hoodlums and cultists in Epe Division of Lagos State. Mr Ladi Kassim, the Welfare Director of the group, expressed the position of the NGO on Monday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Epe. According to him, the situation is “alarming”. He said that many jobless youths and secondary school students were indulging in acts of cultism and hooliganism. “This prompted the group to carry out a sensitisation campaign for youths to desist from such attitude and also to be aware of the punishment attached to them once found guilty,” he said. He said that the organisation would also hold a sensitisation campaign to raise security awareness among indigenes in Epe. He said that the Epe-based NGO was established few months ago and had since carried out several advocacy and sensitisation programmes. Kassim said that the forthcoming event, billed for Dec. 20 with the theme: “Security Awareness Campaign and Road Safety Measures, would engage more than 200 Epe indigenes that would be in attendance. He said the keynote speakers would be Commissioner of Police Adeyeri Sunday, the Division Police Officer (DPO), Epe Division, and Mr Tony Ehidiamen, Unit Commander in the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Epe Unit. He said that some of the programmes that the group had embarked on included a peace talk with some indigenes on the forthcoming 2019 general election and familiarisation tour to traditional rulers in Epe division, among several others. According to him, the security awareness campaign is very important, most especially during these “Ember” months and New Year. “This is Yuletide period when people are carried away by the fun and enjoyments of the season. “So, it is relatively important to sensitise members of the public to peaceful conduct and driving consciously, ” he said.
