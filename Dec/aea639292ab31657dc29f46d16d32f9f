By George Odok  Calabar    –       The All Progressive Congress Governorship Campaign Organisation in Cross River says it will delay the kick-off of its campaign activities in honour its late state chairman, Dr Mathew Achigbe. This was contained in a statement signed by Mr Maurice Effiwat, the Director General of the Campaign Organization on Monday in Calabar. Effiwat said that the funeral obsequies for late Achigbe who died on Nov. 17, would hold from Dec. 3 to Dec. 7. `’In honour of the late state chairman of our party, Dr Achigbe, whose painful exit remains a shock to us, our campaigns will rather kick off in full swing after his interment. “Late Achigbe died in a ghastly motor accident last month along Afikpo road in Ebonyi state on his return trip from a journey outside the state. “The Governorship Campaign Organization of the APC in Cross River, under the flagship of Sen. John Owan-Enoh with his running mate, Mr Ekpo Okon, had since been fired-up to lead a campaign of truth and unity. “The campaign will be issues-based to rally all our tribes, tongues and communities in the state, to unite for the purpose of rescuing, repositioning and moving our beloved state to the next level. “This will be our focus in the days and weeks ahead,” he said. He maintained that the APC Governorship Campaign Organization was determined to win the state in 2019. “More so, we will make everyone understand why Cross River should overwhelmingly vote for President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC candidates. “The numerous political appointments and projects that the state had benefited from the President Buhari-led Federal Government is commendable,’’ he said.
