I have been engaging a young Buhari supporter (names withheld) for some time and some of his submissions actually got me wondering if these guys live in another Nigeria apart from the one we ALL live in. Now to many of them reading this, there are some incontrovertible facts about the Buhari era that even his most ardent supporter can’t fault. These are: * Before Buhari came to power, a bag of rice was N8000. I priced half bag for SAME price just earlier today! * The 5kg cooking oil was N1200 in December 2014, I also haggled one for N3000 today also. * Dollar was N168 but today, N366. * Killings were limited to Boko Haram held areas but today, TEN states are facing crisis of killings. Don’t even talk of kidnappings. * Our foreign and domestic debt stood at N8trn four years ago, but today, it is N21trn. * In SIXTEEN years, N6trn was borrowed. But in Buhari’s THREE years, N11trn was borrowed. * According to Bureau of Statistics, TWO million lost their jobs in SIX years between 2009 and 2015. But in three years, FOUR million lost their jobs under Buhari. * Under Jonathan, only TWO serving government officials were indicted (Oduah and Maduekwe). Stella was dropped. But under Buhari, SIX (Babachir, Buratai, Malami, Kyari, Adeosun, Adebayo Shittu) have been indicted. As we speak. FOUR of them are still keeping their jobs. So much for anti-corruption war. If you want me to mention their names, I will. But I hereby CHALLENGE any Buhari supporter to puncture all I have written above. Post pictures of bridges and roads; of fuel queues; of airport beautification and so on. No matter how bad a government is, if it is a cottage road, it will build. Second bass (not base) jare.
