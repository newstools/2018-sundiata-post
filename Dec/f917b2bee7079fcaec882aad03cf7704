By Monday Ajogun  Benin –   The Edo Government is not disposed to the recruitment of the state’s athletes without due process, the state’s Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu, said on Friday in Benin. Shaibu who held a meeting with  the state’s Sports Commission officials, said necessary steps should be taken if any state wants to poach an Edo athlete. He added that the state government was willing to  go into partnership with any any state interested in its athletes. “We need to have a good collaboration in helping the state in regaining its lost glory. Gov. Godwin Obaseki is willing to put in his best to assist in this cause. “We are going to put a programme in place across the 18 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the state to select athletes for the state sports festival next year. “Since we are the ones hosting the 2020 edition of the National Sports Festival (NSF), we need to start preparing ahead,” the deputy governor said. In his remarks, the state Sports Director, Sunny Airende, thanked the state government for being supportive during  the just-concluded 19th NSF in Abuja. Airende assured the state government that the athletes would continue to put in their best in helping the state regain its lost glory in sports.  (NAN)
