By Cecilia Ijuo Abuja –  The President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to assent to the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill(PIGB) and other bills critical to national development.
Saraki said this in his opening remarks at the 2019 budget presentation by President Muhammadu Buhari, the speech was however not delivered at the ceremony, but was made available to newsmen.
He noted that in response to the economic recession, the National Assembly passed a number of bills to assist the executive mobilise investment into the country to stimulate economic activities.
He said the PIGB alongside National Transport Commission Bill and Federal Road Authority Bill, had not been signed into law, contrary to the expectations of many.
“Let me make it clear that the National Assembly appreciates Your Excellency’s assent to some of these bills.
“We recognise the prerogative of the president to sign or not to sign these bills.
“However, we believe that some of the issues cited for withholding assent may be better addressed through further technical engagements, since the bills are, in the main, aligned to government policy direction,’’ he said.
Saraki said unless the country’s laws were improved upon to create the right structures that enable the private sector to power the economy, job creation and opportunity to thrive and prosper would be difficult.
“I must commend the President for the Social Investment Programme initiative.
“However, as laudable as this initiative has been, it is pertinent to note that the current approach is unlikely to have a sustainable, measurable impact that is free of corruption and abuse.
“You will agree with me that such a programme should carry no whiff of politicisation. Our role as leaders must always be to ensure that we deliver governance results that do not discriminate.
“We should also ensure that all Nigerians irrespective of ethnicity, religion and political stride have access and are seen to be treated equally,” he said.
Saraki expressed the National Assembly’s readiness to work with Buhari on the peoples-oriented programmes of the administration to ensure success.
He assured the President that the assembly would continue to work with him and his team to ensure that whatever was required through legislation and oversight to plug revenue leakages and ramp up revenues was given priority.
