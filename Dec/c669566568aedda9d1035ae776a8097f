At 72, Buhari said he won’t be able to perform as expected due to old age. But you are dying for him at 76 to rule till 81. At least officially. Because, to you, he is “getting younger” while his vice is growing older despite being EIGHTEEN years younger. * Buhari told governors that economy is in very bad shape. But you come on Facebook everyday to reel out how economy is booming since 2015. * Buhari said his inspector-general of police did not carry out his instruction. Yet, you claim he is totally on charge of his government. * The man said Nigerians should pray to curb insurgency. But you claim how he is fighting terrorism every day. * Buhari said he could not vouch for most of his aides. But same you defend these aides on daily basis against sundry allegations. My Take:
Buhari is NOT the problem. But the LOW MINDS who seem to know this man than himself. A man will rate himself and you will say he is wrong with the rating. Psychiatric homes need more inmates… Source: Facebook
