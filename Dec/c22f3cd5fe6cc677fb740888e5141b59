By Emmanuel Oloniruha  Abuja   –         President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, on Thursday urged Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to defend the nation’s democracy as the country prepared for general elections in 2019. Saraki, who is also the Director-General of the Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Council (PDP-PPCCO), made the call at an interactive session with CSOs in Abuja. He said that the destiny of Nigeria was in the hands of all citizens as they would be deciding who would rule the country in less than two months. “We should have a country where it does not matter what part of the country you come from and what religion you worship. “That is the type of country I am sure all of us dream and pray and work for. “We must all stand up and make sure that we stand and fight for what is right for this country and nobody does that better, not even us the politicians. “So, for us as the campaign organisation, we believe that we cannot be successful in the campaign if we do not have you side-by-side as partners fighting for a course,” he said. Saraki said that the session was for the PDP candidate and his campaign organisation to be able to interact with the CSOs to form partnership in the interest of the country. “This is because we all want a country that is secured. Today there’s no need being sentimental, the facts speak for themselves. “We want a country that will fight this poverty and fight this hunger that is in the land,” he said. Atiku’s running mate, Mr Peter Obi, decried allocation of 60 per cent of the 2019 Appropriation Bill presented by President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday, to servicing debt. He deplored the level of poverty in the country, and urged Nigerians to tighten their belts. Obi also expressed worry over the recent rise in unemployment rate from 18.8 per cent to 23 per cent, expressing fear that it could get worse.
