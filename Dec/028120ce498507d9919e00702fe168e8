Abuja(SundiataPost) -Over 400,000 people are to benefit from various interventions on peace building sponsored by the European Union (EU) through the British Council in areas affected by insurgency in the North East states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe. The intervention programmes would be implemented in the three states by Managing Conflict in Nigeria (MCN), an NGO. Ukoha Ukiwo, Head of the MCN, made the disclosure at a workshop on Conflict Sensitive Communication and Election Reporting, it organised for journalists in Yola on Thursday. He said that the beneficiaries would be drawn from communities, government institutions and security agencies in the affected states. According to him, over four million other residents in the targeted communities would also benefit indirectly in the areas of conflict managements, reconciliation, women empowerment and reintegration. Ukiwo said that the goal of the intervention was to support government and communities to reduce violence, and enhance stability and security necessary for human development. “The objective is to enhance the capacity of government and community institutions to manage conflicts better in non-violent ways in order to reduce the incidence and impact of violent conflicts.” He said that the ongoing training for media practitioners in the affected states became necessary as they play a vital role in influencing conflict.
