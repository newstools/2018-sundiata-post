By Solomon Asowata  Lagos   –     A Nigerian deported from Italy, Mr Tony Lucky has apologised to the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) for assaulting its officers at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos on Dec. 14. A top official of the NIS told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on condition of anonymity that Lucky in the apology promised not to engage in such unruly conducts in future. The source said contrary to a video currently trending on the social media, officers of the NIS were only trying to carry out their statutory duty of profiling people deported back to Nigeria. “His name on the ECOWAS Traveling Certificate (ETC) is Tony Lucky. He arrived aboard a Turkish Airline flight on Dec. 14. ” In the course of immigration profiling, he became violent insisting that he has no reason to be asked questions about his details. “He had no passport on him and was not ready to answer any question about the passport or give information about himself, more so as none of the names on the ETC is a Nigerian name,” the source said. According to the source, when Lucky was told that it is compulsory that he supply his detailed information and also have his finger prints on the back of the ETC, he became violent and tried to force his way out in order to evade immigration clearance. “In the process, he landed a punch on one of our officers ACII D. Mamman,
which led to mouth bleeding. ” He virtually assaulted everyone that came his way. It was a difficult task before we were able to take him to the duty room. “At the duty room, he realised his mistakes because the probable effects of alcohol he consumed on the flight had subsided and he wrote an apology letter for his misbehaviour,” the source said.
