By Kadiri Abdulrahmam Abuja –  The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) says it has secured three convictions in two weeks.
NAPTIP’s spokesman, Mr Adekoya Vincent, said this in a statement issued on Friday in Abuja.
It said that a 25-year-old trafficker, Eric David, was on Thursday (Dec. 6) sentenced to seven years imprisonment.
The agency said that the conviction came two weeks after another two traffickers were sent to prison for similar offence.
“The war against human trafficking is very effective and we are making some progress.
“Just yesterday (Thursday) one Eric David, a 25-year-old man was sentenced to seven years imprisonment by Justice Oguntoyibo of the Federal High Court in Lagos.
“The convict was found guilty of trafficking a 19-year-old girl (name withheld) to Mali for sexual exploitation,” the statement said.
He said that the convict had earlier trafficked some of his victims to Mali for prostitution and returned to Nigeria to recruit more girls before he was arrested.
“The latest conviction comes barely one week after another Court in Lagos sent two other traffickers to prison for trafficking some girls abroad for prostitution,” it added.
It noted that the prosecution and conviction of traffickers would serve as a motivation for NAPTIP and its operatives to do more. (NAN)
