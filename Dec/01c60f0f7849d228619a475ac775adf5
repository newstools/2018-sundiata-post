Antananarivo –   The African Union saluted the calmness during Madagascar’s run-off Presidential election held on Wednesday, Head of the African Union Election Observation Mission Ramtane Lamamra, said on Friday. Lamamra said this during a news conference held in Antananarivo. “The African Union congratulates Madagascar’s government and the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) for additional efforts to improve the electoral process,’’ Lamamra said. During the news conference, Lamamra also commended candidates for this run-off presidential election and politicians who, in spite of obvious divergence of views on certain aspects of the process, have been able to show restraint. The AU head of mission encouraged the candidates to choose dialogue and recourse to legal channels for the settlement of all disputes. On behalf of the AU Election Observation Mission, Lamamra also welcomed the strong involvement of women in the electoral process. She said that about 47.8 per cent of polling station members, 57.2 per cent of candidate representatives and 61 per cent of national observers were women. The African Union sent 35 observers from various member countries. They arrived in Madagascar on Dec. 12, for a stay of 11 days.  (Xinhua/NAN)
