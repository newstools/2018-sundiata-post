Aisha Ahmed  Kano –  Africa Check, an non-partisan organisation, has organised a two-day training for 16 journalists from Kano on Fact-checking Elections. Mr David Ajikobi, while declaring the workshop open on Monday, said that the training aimed at preparing journalists to access accurate and factual information while reporting the elections. Ajikobi said that the training would use standard fact checking methodologies in covering the 2019 elections. He explained that fake news posed threat to the general elections in view of its effect during the recent elections in Ekiti and Osun States. He challenged journalists to search for facts and check their sources accurately as the larger society capitalised on them for credible reports of the elections. In his presentation, the Director of the International Press Centre, Lagos, Mr Lanre Arogundade, challenged journalists to study the election framework and other codes as guides. Arogundade reminded the journalists of their task to educate and enlighten the public on credible information. He reminded the participants to always bear in mind that their tribe would always be “Journalism.” The training, which opened in Kano on Monday, drew participants from many media houses. (NAN)
