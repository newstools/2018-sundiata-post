By Nabilu Balarabe  Kirikasamma     –        The National Orientation Agency (NOA) in Jigawa, on Monday, urged residents of Kirikasamma Local Government Area to always assist security agents with information on the activities of criminals in the area. The NOA director in the state, Alhaji Shuaibu Haruna, who was represented by the agency’s Administrative Officer, Alhaji Shittu Umar, made this plea at a sensitisation programme in Kirikasamma. According to Haruna, assisting security operatives with credible information for crime management is the moral responsibility of every patriotic citizen. “It is our duty to help security with credible information in order to fight crime and make our environment safe and it is an offence to take laws into your hands. “It is also important that the security operatives are allowed to do their job and avoid sharing the information you give them with others,” he said. Haruna advised the residents to ensure that they voted for credible candidates in the 2019 general elections. “Always vote for candidates with track records of excellence and credibility and avoid candidates with history of thuggery and those with questionable characters. “Vote for people, who will not betray your trust and those who will unite you at all times,” he said. In his remarks, the council chairman, Alhaji Salisu Garba-Kubayo, lauded NOA for organising the programme. He noted that raising awareness on the need to obey the law ahead of the general elections could not have come at a better time. Garba-Kubayo expressed gratitude to the security outfits in the area for their cooperation, which he said was responsible for the decrease in drug abuse and violent crimes in the area.
