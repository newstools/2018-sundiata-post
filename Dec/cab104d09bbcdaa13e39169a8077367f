By Aminu Ahmed Garko  Minna   –    The Niger command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has deployed 2,500 officers and men to ensure peaceful Christmas celebration in the state. Mr Philip Ayuba, the NSCC Commandant in the state, made this known on Monday in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna. Ayuba said that the personnel were deployed to churches, recreational centres and motor parks, among other public places, to boost security arrangements across the state. He, however, urged the general public to be law-abiding, while eschewing acts that could foment trouble or contravene the law during and after the celebration. “We want to assure the general public that NSCDC and other security agencies have put in place necessary strategies to guarantee peace during and after the Christmas festivities. “We also want to use this medium to call on citizens of Niger to report to the security agencies any movement suspected to have the potential of threatening the peace and security of the state,’’ he said. He urged the Christian faithful to pray for hitch-free 2019 elections in the state and in the country in general.
