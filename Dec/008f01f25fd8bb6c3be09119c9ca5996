By Peter Okolie  Onitsha (Anambra) –   Mrs Jennifer Atiku, wife of Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has urged residents of Onitsha to vote massively for the party in the 2019 general elections. Jennifer, who hails from Onitsha, made the plea when she paid a courtesy visit to Igwe Alfred Achebe, the traditional ruler of Onitsha on Tuesday. “I am here to inform you, my own people, that your in-law, who is my husband, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is contesting the presidential election in 2019, so that you support us to win the election. “I am your daughter and your in-law is my husband. You asked me to marry him and here I am today to seek your support for his presidential ambition. “Please, do not let us down,” Jennifer, who was accompanied by Mrs Margret Obi, wife of Mr Peter Obi, the Vice Presidential candidate of the party, pleaded. While saying that her visit was to buttress the saying that “charity begins at home,” Jennifer expressed optimism that a PDP government would guarantee the desired economic and social development of the country. In his response, the Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe, commended Mrs Jennifer for finding time to visit the palace and Onitsha to canvass for votes for Atiku and PDP. “It will be good if our in-law becomes the President of Nigeria. You are a good daughter and your husband, our in-law is also a good man. “Since you deemed it fit to seek my blessing from the throne and support of your people for your husband, Atiku, who is our in-law, what you are praying for will be fulfilled by the grace of God,” the monarch said. In a remark, the PDP candidate for Onitsha South 11 constituency, Mr Jude Omennajiego, assured that the party would guarantee the people of the area dividends of democracy, if elected into office.
