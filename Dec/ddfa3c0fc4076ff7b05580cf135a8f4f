Abakaliki,   –      The Ebonyi State Government has approved N3.7m for the treatment of a 12 year-old victim of maltreatment by her mistress in the state. Mr Godwin Igwe, the Head of Department (HOD), Child Welfare, Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Monday in Abakaliki. Igwe said that medical report revealed that the minor, Miss Faith Nwanja would go deaf and blind in future if prompt intervention was not made for her treatment. NAN recalls that Nwanja was allegedly dehumanised by her mistress, Mrs Nkechinyere Bartholomew in March. He explained that the victim had undergone some medical examinations by a team of medical experts because of the level of injury inflicted on her. “The suspect inflicted injuries in almost all parts of Nwanja’s body and the hospital has advised to commence treatment to avoid blindness and deafness. “She has physical scars on her skin, lip, chopped ear, mouth, fractured hand, head and internal injuries,” Igwe said. The HOD noted that the governor also released fund quarterly to the ministry to take comprehensive care of vulnerable children in the rehabilitation home. He commended the governor and his wife Rachael for improving lives, intervention programmes and campaigns to stop all forms of violence against children and women. Igwe also applauded the Commissioner of the ministry, Mrs Rebecca Ogbuewu for her efforts in the progress of the ministry. “The suspect who is currently in prison awaits trial and should be judged accordingly to serve as deterrent to any intending perpetrators. “I plead to all relevant authorities such as the police and judiciary to bring justice to the innocent girl,” Igwe said.
