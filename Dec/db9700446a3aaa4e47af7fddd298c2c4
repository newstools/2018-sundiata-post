By Naomi Sharang  Abuja –   The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has denied arresting the sons of Presidential Candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. EFCC’s Acting Spokesperson, Mr Tony Orilade, made the denial in a statement in Abuja, on Monday. According to Orilade, we have received several calls and e-mail messages asking us to confirm the arrest of the sons of Abubakar as being alleged in some quarters. ”Some only said we raided the apartments of Atiku’s sons looking for foreign currencies. ”This is nothing but another tales by moonlight.” He said that the commission, as a responsible organisation, was abreast of the establishment mandate and shall not deviate from such mandate. ”We never went after Atiku’s sons, neither were Atiku’s sons among the two boys arrested.” The spokesperson, however, said “it is in the news that we have been investigating the former Abia governor, Sen. Theodore Orji, over alleged N27 billion money-laundering. ”In the course of investigation, we discovered that he laundered part of the money through his sons. ”We have been on the trail of some of the purchases made by his sons, including the cars the boys allegedly bought. ”There is no link whatsoever to Atiku.” (NAN)
