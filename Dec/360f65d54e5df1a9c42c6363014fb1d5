He said that the launch of the programme was part of the centre’s effort
toward contributing to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) five and nine, targeted at gender equality, industry, innovation
and infrastructure. He added that there were few women in the area studying astronomy and
other relates science courses. He said “Some of the tools that we are developing to address
SDGs include automated irrigation system for agriculture to ensure
food sufficiency and guarantee year-round farming. “We also have infrared thermometer which can be deployed in the
health sector and the most recent one which is the solar tracker for
energy supply. “We are also encouraging women to go into basic space science to
address gender imbalance. So some of our girls and
women are involved in space science now.” He explained that the launch of the women and girls in astronomy programme
next year would boost their participation into the area of space research.
