By EricJames Ochigbo Abuja,   –      A member of the House of Representatives, Rep. Gabriel Onyieawife, has defected from All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
The defection announcement was contained in a letter read at the floor of the hallow chambers by the Speaker, Mr Yakubu Dogara, at the plenary on Wednesday.
Onyieawife, who represents Ayamelum/Oyi Federal Constituency of Anambra, attributed his defection to the factions in APGA.
Meanwhile, Dogara has administered oath of office on three new members.
Rep. Yusuf Nuhu (Bauchi), Rep. Tunji Olawuyi (Kwara) and Rep. Abubakar Kusada (Katsina) are all of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
While Rep. Nuhu represents Toro Federal Constituency of Bauchi State, Rep. Kusada would represent Kankia/Kusada Federal Constituency of Katsina State and Rep. Olawuyi would represent Irepodun/Isin/Oke Ero/Ekiti federal constituency of Ekiti State.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the new legislators were recently elected to represent their constituencies to fill vacancies in the green chambers as a result of death and decisions to run for the Senate by former occupants.
