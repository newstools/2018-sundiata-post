By Abiodun Lawal   Abeokuta   –         The Ogun House of Assembly, on Wednesday, advised the state government to release funds for the rehabilitation of stadia facilities in the state. Mr Victor Fasanya, House Committee Chairman on Finance and Appropriation, gave this advice during the Ministry of Youths and Sports’ defence of budgetary allocation in the 2019 budget at the assembly complex, Abeokuta. The lawmaker expressed concern that the Muda Lawal Stadium, Asero and the MKO Abiola Stadium, Kuto, both in Abeokuta, as well as Dipo Dina, Ijebu Ode, Sagamu and Ilaro Stadia were not in good condition. Fasanya urged members of the House Committee on Youths and Sports to visit the stadia and report back to the House. The lawmaker tasked the ministry to further encourage youths at the grassroots by scouting for sports talents beyond the cosmopolitan areas of the state. Mrs Juliana Akintayo, a committee member, said communities at the grassroots paraded untapped sporting talents, who could win more medals when given the opportunity to attend local and international competitions. Akintayo stressed the need for the ministry to partner more with corporate organisations and philanthropists in the state to strengthen the state’s league and other sporting competitions. Defending the 2019 budget proposal of the ministry, the Director of Public Private Partnership, Mr Isqeel Aboaba, disclosed that N1.2 billion would be expended by the ministry. Aboaba, who explained that one billion naira would be spent on various capital projects; N235 million for recurrent expenditure, added that two million naira was set as revenue target for the period under review. Aboaba stated that the ministry would put in place structures and templates in preparation for the National Sports Festival in 2019. The director added that N933.3 million had been earmarked for stadia rehabilitation and other special projects in the state.
