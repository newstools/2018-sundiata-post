By Ikenna Osuoha  Abuja –   Christian Chukwu, a former coach of Rangers International Football Club, says he is optimistic of the club’s chances of qualifying for the group stage of the CAF Confederation Cup. Chukwu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Abuja that the Enugu-based club was capable of winning the fixture to advance to the group. He said his belief was based on optimism derived from knowing the level of the players’ fitness and determination to make Nigeria proud. NAN reports that the Nigeria Pofessional Football League (NPFL) side have been drawn to face Bantu FC of Lesotho in their second round of 16 fixture in the competition. “This is the easiest one of the draws for Rangers in history and we hope to utilise the opportunity. “We are very happy to be in our group and we will make Nigerians proud by qualifying, ” the former Super Eagles coach, who is also Rangers Team Manager, said. The reigning Aiteo Cup champions were handed a perceived easy draw as they avoided some of the heavyweights on the continent. Rangers will now be hoping to repeat their heroics against USM Bel Abbes of Algeria to bring them to the final preliminary round. The first leg tie of this new fixture will be played in Lesotho on Jan 11, while the second leg tie will be played in Enugu on Jan. 18.  (NAN)
