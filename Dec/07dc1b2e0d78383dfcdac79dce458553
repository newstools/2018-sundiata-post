By Tinuade Adeshiyan   Mowe (Ogun State)   –      Prof. Anthony Akinlo, Vice-Chancellor of Redeemer’s University, Ede, Osun State, on Thursday urged Nigerians to pray for God’s intervention in the nation’s education sector to secure the future of Nigerian children. Speaking during a prayer session at the ongoing 2018 Holy Ghost Congress at the Redemption Camp, Mowe, Ogun, Akinlo said that the country’s education sector required divine intervention to save it from collapsing. “The education sector in the nation requires serious attention because education is the total development of mankind. “We acquire knowledge through education and when it’s not well attended to, it is the other way round. “As individuals and as a church, it is imperative to pray for the sector so as to avert danger in the future of the sector,” the VC said. Akinlo prayed that God should inculcate his fear in the hearts of all students and school administrators. He also prayed to God to guide Nigerian schools and restore goodness into Nigerian education. He appealed to worshipers to take the prayer seriously even in their privacy, saying “the sector is the life of every nation; therefore, there is need for Nigerians to call on God for intervention in the sector.
