The cybercrime law that the Buhari government employs to harass critics now was signed into operation by President Jonathan. Some portions of the law are clearly repressive. For example, section 24, which deals with “cyberstalking”, and which security agencies use as a cover to harass citizens. But just as I criticise the Buhari administration for hounding critics; I will criticise the Jonathan administration for being the mother of that law. A few minutes ago, Doyin Okupe, who served in Jonathan’s government and was a strong voice of the administration, cried out that EFCC agents were at his house at Ilupeju, Lagos state, to arrest him for “cybercrime”. Is this a repression bomerang? What was the thinking of the Jonathan administration in bringing that law into life? We must be careful about making laws. Laws made for political purposes often end up consuming the framers and the promoters. Source: Facebook
