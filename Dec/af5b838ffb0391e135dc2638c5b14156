By Doris Esa Abuja –   The Nigerian Air Force said the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation DIRAN MIKIYA successfully neutralised an armed bandits hideout at a compound West of Tsamari in Birnin Magaji Local Government Area of Zamfara. Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja. He explained that the attack was conducted at dawn on Dec. 28, following intelligence reports indicating that the compound was being used by the armed bandits as a camp from where they launch attacks on innocent civilians. Accordingly, the ATF detailed a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft, which confirmed the presence of bandits armed with high calibre weapons at the location. “Consequently, an Alpha Jet aircraft was dispatched to strike the compound, recording direct hits on the target area and resulting in significant damage to the structures and neutralisation of some bandits. “This was later confirmed by credible human intelligence sources,’’ he said. Daramola said surface troops later invaded the compound and recovered some motorcycles abandoned by the fleeing criminals. “The ATF working in concert with surface forces and other security agencies, will continue to conduct reconnaissance and air interdiction missions with a view to restoring normalcy to the affected states in the North-west.’’  (NAN)
