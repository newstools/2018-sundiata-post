Seun Kuti, Nigerian Afrobeats musician, has been nominated for the 2019 Grammy Awards. The performer was nominated in the best world music album category for ‘Black Times’. Kuti was nominated alongside his Egypt 80 band. He will compete with Fatoumata Diawara, Bombino, Soweto Gospel Choir, and Yiddish Glory for the award. “I really hope to get nominated and I hope we will also win. This album is my best work. Just like my shows, I make sure that my last album has to be my best album,” he said in a recent interview. The ‘Black Times’ album was released in March and it earned him his first ever entry on the Billboard music charts. The descendant of the Kuti music dynasty will take the stage during the upcoming Afrobeat Festival alongside his Egypt 80 band. In a November tweet, Bizzle Osikoya, musical promoter, said Adekunle Gold, Burna Boy and Yemi Alade were also being considered for a Grammy nomination. They were also being considered for the best world album category. Kendrick Lamar and Drake, hip hop artistes, earned the most recognition bagging eight and seven nominations each. Boi-1da and Brandi Carlile earned six nominations apiece while Cardi B, Childish Gambino, H.E.R., Lady Gaga, Maren Morris, Soundwave and Mike Bozzi each bagged five nods.
