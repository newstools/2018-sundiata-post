Abuja(SundiataPost) –Dr Osas Ikponwonsa, the Chief Medical Director of Calvary Estate Hospital, Benin, on Friday said that cardiac arrest could lead to sudden death if not treated immediately. Ikponwonsa told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin that cardiac arrest is “the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness”. He said, “Sudden cardiac arrest occurs suddenly and often without warning. It is usually triggered by an electrical malfunction in the heart that causes an irregular heartbeat also called (arrhythmia). “When this happens, the heart no longer pumps blood to the brain, lungs and other organs.’’ The medical practitioner said that there was a difference between a heart attack and sudden cardiac arrest. “A heart attack occurs when blood supply to the heart stops and thus causes a section of the heart muscle to begin to die, whereas a sudden cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating as a whole. “The condition usually results from an electrical disturbance in the heart that disrupts its pumping action, stopping blood flow to the body. “However, a heart attack can sometimes be triggered by an electrical disturbance that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest, “he said. Ikponwonsa said that with the application of appropriate medical care, such as giving compression to the chest of the patient, it could improve the chances of survival of the victim. He said this would serve as a restorative means pending the arrival of emergency workers. He said that sudden cardiac arrest’s symptoms include: chest discomfort, shortness of breath, weakness, and palpitations. According to the expert, the causes of sudden cardiac arrest include: a problem in the heart rhythm (arrhythmia), the result of a problem with the heart’s electrical system. He advised anyone with such symptoms to seek medical attention immediately. (NAN)
