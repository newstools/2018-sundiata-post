By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post)  – Erstwhile governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has queried President Muhammadu Buhari on the decision to flag off his presidential campaign for his re-election in peaceful Akwa Ibom instead of Zamfara or Borno. He also accused the President of making “only phone calls” to the troubled states, which have been the hotbed of killings in recent times. According to Fayose, Buhari should have chosen Zamfara, Yobe or Borno for his campaign flag-off, rather than the “peaceful Akwa Ibom”. He stated this in a tweet that read: “Nigerians are being killed in Zamfara, President Buhari could only make ‘phone calls’. But he is going to Akwa Ibom, a state made peaceful by the PDP Govt of @MrUdomEmmanuel to flag off his campaign. Why can’t he do the flag off in Zamfara, Yobe or Borno?” Sundiata Post recalls that President Buhari will today, 28th December, flag off his presidential campaign in Uyo, the Akwa Ibom state capital.
