By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu –   The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) on Saturday commended Colleges of Education  Academic Staff Union (COEASU) for calling off its two-month strike. The union called off the strike after an agreement with the Federal Government. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that COEASU members resumed lectures across colleges nationwide on Dec. 6. NANS’ National Public Relations Officer, Mr Bestman Okereafor, said in Enugu on Saturday that there was need for ASUU to also call off its strike. “The attention of the apex students governing body, NANS, has been drawn to the recent suspension of the over two months industrial action embarked upon by COEASU members. “This came after the academic union reached an agreement with the Federal Government earlier this week. “NANS is appealing to their counterparts at the university level, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), to be honourable by suspending their ongoing strike without further delay. “The ASUU strike has really affected Nigerian students negatively,’’ Okereafor said. He urged stakeholders in the education sector and well-meaning Nigerians to rally round the Federal Government to find lasting solution to tertiary education funding in the country. “There must be a new thinking and ways of doing things to solve the persistent funding challenges of tertiary institutions nationwide,’’ he said.
