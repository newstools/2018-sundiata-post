By Salisu Sani-Idris Abuja –  Mr Tony Oyatedor, President, NewsTime International, on Tuesday advised the Federal Government to initiate peace moves to end insurgency in the North East and militancy in the Niger Delta. Oyatedor, who spoke at a news conference in Abuja, said the current military approach of the use of weapons to end crisis only magnified rather than mitigate the problem. According to him, Nigeria needs to make peace with the twin problems, because the country is nourished by food from the North and oil from the Niger Delta. He stated that the people and leadership of Nigeria, must follow the rule of law, not the rule of force, saying; “invest in solutions not weapons and you will harvest peace and prosperity.’’ “When you invest in weapons, you get war and destruction, but when you invest in the word, you get peace and security,” he said. He stressed that the country’s leadership must make peace with both issues, not because they wanted to, but because they had to. He also advised the leadership of the country to implement a roadmap for what a peaceful, stable, secure and prosperous Nigeria would look like. “There is an urgent need for new thinking about the problems; this is less about us and more about the future of the country. “Nigeria has been crippled and brought to its knees by the evil twins of Boko Haram and militancy, the twin problems that could have been prevented and brought to a screeching halt,” he said. He further urged the Federal Government to make a covenant of peace to ensure accelerated development in the country.  (NAN)
