…Orders NIWA to Ensure Mandatory Usage of Life Jacket by Passengers Travelling Across River Niger By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Senate on Wednesday mandated the Federal Government to urgently intervene in the construction of the Lafiagi-Niger state road. It also mandated the National Inland Waterways Agency (NIWA) to ensure the mandatory usage of life jacket by passengers travelling across the river Niger, other rivers and oceans in Nigeria. This followed the motion of ‘avoidable boat mishap’ brought before it by lawmaker representing Kwara North senatorial district, Senator Mohammed Shaaba Lafiagi. Senator Lafiagi while moving the motion, informed that a boat mishap that occurred in Lafiagi on 1st December led to the drowning of 19 persons aged between 12 and 19 years while travelling across the river Niger. He recalled that the use of canoes and boats is the only available means of transportation for the border towns of Lafiagi in Kwara State and its neighbours in Niger State. According the him, the ancient town of Lafiagi in Edu Local Government council has been in a mournful mood since the drowning of the 19 little children after the passenger boat they boarded capsized midway across the river Niger. He reminded that such ugly incident occurs intermittently as a result of lack of access road in the riverine community. The Kwara Senator expressed sadness that if the 46kilometre road linking Lafiagi to its ndibours in Niger State had been constructed by the government, such incident would have been eliminated or reduced considerably. He  said asked that the road be constructed or a bridge built across the river Niger as this will not only enhance businesses and trade, but will also reduce the risk to lives of his people. The senate observed a minute silence in honour of the departed children and send a delegation from the senate to condole the people and government of Kwara State.
