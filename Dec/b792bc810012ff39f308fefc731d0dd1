Istanbul –  Turkish Authorities have confiscated 1.5 tons of hashish stashed on a truck with an estimated street value of 7.6 million U.S. dollars. The drugs were packed in sacks on a truck at the Ipsala border crossing with Greece in Edirne province, the Trade Ministry said on Friday. The truck, initially registered as carrying soybeans, made it through an X-ray check, but was then flagged up by a sniffer dog. Hidden in 152 sacks, it was the largest shipment of drugs confiscated at Turkish borders, the ministry said. The driver, who is an Albanian national, and two other people were arrested. (dpa/NAN)
