By Bolanle Lawal Ado-Ekiti –   Mr Babatunde Adebiyi, the Head of Operations of the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in Ekiti, has warned residents of the state against overspeeding during the festive period. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that he made the warning on Monday during the flag off of the “Operation Eagle Eye” campaign in Ado-Ekiti . He said that the exercise, which was in collaboration with the Federal Road Safety Commission, Red Cross, Police and Nigeria Civil Defence Corps, was to ensure a free flow of vehicles during the festive period. The NEMA boss advised all commercial drivers to refrain from over speeding in the bid to maximise profit. “If truly you love your loved ones, don’t over speed while driving. “Don’t drink to stay strong, it weakens the body rather than make it active as some believe, ” he added. In the same vein, the Sector Commander of the FRSC, Mr Kugu Ismaila, stressed the need for drivers to always put on their seat belts. He added that the seat belt was not meant for drivers alone but also for all other passengers, especially in private cars. Kugu said that FRSC personnel would be available during the festive period to ensure a free flow of traffic and reduce road crashes. He also advised the drivers to be patient in view of the high expectations attached to the festive season .  (NAN)
