In case you have forgotten. Adebato Shittu was prevented from contesting for the governorship ticket of APC in Oyo State because of NYSC certificate. But he is still Minister of the Republic. As far as APC and Buhari are concerned, you don’t need NYSC to become a minister. In case you have forgotten. Babachir Lawal was sacked as Secretary to the Government of the Federation for sundry abuse of office by awarding contracts to his own firms. He is today a KEY member of Buhari Second Term Campaign team. In case you have forgotten. Godswill Akpabio had case with EFCC and his wife even admitted to PUNCH Newspaper that they used to fear that every knock at their gate was from EFCC operatives. The former Akwa Ibom governor is now at peace. The kind of ‘peace’ APC gives you when you decamp. In case you have forgotten. By law, Governor Kayode Fayemi was not qualified to contest for governorship of Ekiti State having failed to resign his ministerial appointment at the time stipulated by the Law. But he got away with. APC is in power. Members are above the law. In case you have forgotten. Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, former Finance Minister, queried why Malami, Attorney-General of the Federation, would fork out $6m as “local legal fees” for the Abacha Loot. Malami got away with it. Some said that was part of what ‘nailed’ Adeosun. In case you have forgotten. A businessman accused the Chief of Staff to the President if duping him to the tune of N390m for contracts that never came. Businessman was arrested but EFCC has successfully killed the case. I can go on. Any time they say they are fighting corruption, remind them of these. I repeat: sell Buhari and market him for second term. You are free. It is within your rights. But stop insulting our intelligence with his anti-corruption ‘feats’. It is nauseating. Source: Facebook
