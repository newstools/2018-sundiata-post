By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu – The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC), says it will redouble efforts to deal decisively with buyers of stolen and vandalised electrical installations in 2019. The company’s Head of Communications, Mr Emeka Ezeh, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Enugu that EEDC would step up its efforts in apprehending buyers of vandalised electrical installations. According to him, it is believed that the buyers are the ones who motivate vandals to continue indulging in such nefarious act. “If there is no one buying the items, there won’t be that motivation for the vandals to engage in this act,’’ he said. EEDC spokesman, who recalled that two buyers were jailed in 2017, expressed the hope that after due process of the law, those apprehended in 2018 would also serve their terms in prison. “We will not relent in this struggle and we hope that this will serve as deterrent to many others that are engaging in such criminal activities of buying stolen or vandalised EEDC property,’’ Ezeh said. He said that it was worrisome that while EEDC had been striving to improve on its service delivery, some individuals were engaging in illegitimate activities to frustrate both the company and its customers. “This singular act costs EEDC a lot financially, and ends up subjecting our customers to a lot of inconveniences,’’ he said. He, however, solicited the cooperation and support of the various vigilante groups and state security agencies to apprehend and prosecute the vandals accordingly.  (NAN)
