Abuja(SundiataPost)- Miss Zainab Suleiman, a 26-year old candidate for the Kano State House of Assembly election, has called on the youths to take advantage of the Not-Too-Young-To-Run Act to bring fresh ideas into governance in the country. Suleiman, who is contesting on the platform of the New ProgressiveS Movement (NPM), made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) in Abuja. “Young people should come into the system because you can only win when you try, and with time, you will come to limelight. “Pursue your dream, let us do what will be better for us as young people and as a country,” she said. The candidate said she was contesting to represent Kumbotso Local Government Area of Kano State to initiate bills that would benefit women and youths. She said that most of the time, women were left out of the decision-making process, especially in Kano State. According to her, only one woman has made it to the state assembly for only one term “and since then, no one else”. “We want more women to venture into politics; we want more women in parliament and I am taking the lead. “In Kano State, there are some positions that should be for young people. I am leveraging on the Not-Too-Young-To-Run Act and I want more young people to do likewise,” Suleiman said.(NAN)
