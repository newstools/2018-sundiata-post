By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post)  – National leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the PDP Presidential Campaign Organization (PPCO) lament the death of its loyal and dedicated members of our great party and other Nigerians in a ghastly motor accident in Benue State. The party bemoans the painful death of the members and described them as heroes of democracy, who paid the supreme price in the course of their commitment towards rescuing our dear nation from shackles of misrule. PDP expressed ita grief on Saturday In a statement signed by the Director, Media & Publicity, PDP Presidential Campaign Organization, Kola Ologbondiyan sent to Sundisha Post. The PDP leadership is particularly pained that these party faithful died on their way to the flag-off of the PDP Benue South Senatorial campaign, in their quest to ensure an acceptable, people-oriented representation of their zone in the Senate. The PDP commends Governor Samuel Ortom, other leaders and members of the party in Benue State for their interventions and charged members from other states to join in extending their hands of fellowship towards the bereaved and the wounded at this critical time. The party also called on members to ensure that the deceased did not die in vain by remaining united in working harder, now, more than ever before, to ensure the party’s victory in all elections in the state. While praying for the peaceful repose of the soul of the dead and speedy recovery for the wounded, the party deeply condoles with their families, the PDP Benue Chapter as well as the government and people of Benue state, for this tragedy.
