ABUJA (Sundiata Post) It’s a master stroke. And they are sulking. The president has done the right thing. A thing they could have done but chose not to. Now they must colour his intentions, paint him bad. They ought to hide their faces. The Omniscient one of Owu must be gnashing his teeth though. That recognition given another son of Ogun could give him a heart attack. It will definitely tell on his mission to see off the Daura man. We could be in for another long letter The PDP claims it’s hypocrisy. Look who is talking! It had 16 years. The public welcomes the sort of hypocrisy that rights wrongs and compensates victims manifest injustice. The PDP hasn’t repented from blatant dishonesty. It couldn’t argue that the honors weren’t well deserved. It couldn’t give reasons why it failed to award them. It’s now blabbing gibberish about greek gifts. The real greek gifts are those small parcels of dollars stolen from the treasury and given by a certain president to Yoruba Obas on the eve of the 2015 elections. A single upper cut has left a multitude of knockouts. Ouch! Minna is on the canvass too. He must feel dismantled. It must be nightmarish. Abiola’s ghost has been knighted. The absurdity and shame of the annulment has been reconstituted. Justice Bello chose legalism. It won’t work. The honors are presidential prerogative. The national Honors act doesn’t limit the president to living persons. Once the president is not expressly limited, then he is free indeed. Abiola and Gani merited the honors. President Buhari is a Daniel who has come to judgment. Restitution is a virtue. Dont tear your dresses. The president has not authored waywardness. There wont be two democracy day holidays this year. The June 12 national holiday will start next year. The president can make such declarations when he chooses. President Buhari is perhaps not that politically naive, after all. He knows his political bases.
