By Raji Rasak  Lagos   –     A former Minister of Power, Prof. Barth Nnaji, on Tuesday urged the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to embrace cost reflective tariff for effective and regular power supply. Nnaji told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that there would be problem if the tariff was not cost reflective like we have in Nigeria. “The tariff we here two years ago is still what we are using, whereas, the nation’s currency had been devalued by 50 per cent already. “There is need for the tariff to be adjusted so that consumers will be able to enjoy electricity supply. “This mean that the entire power value chain have to be worked out for effective and efficient power delivery,” he said. Nnaji, who is the Chairman of Geometric Power Ltd., said that electricity tariff was supposed to be amended every year. According to him, it can go up and it can go down depending on the nature of the country’s currency. On the level of performance by investors, he said that the criteria set out for the privatisation of power sector in 2013 was based on technical and financial capacity.
