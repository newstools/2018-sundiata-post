By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  Minister of Information and Culture,  Alhaji Lai Mohammed has described Obasanjo’s alarm that the Federal Government  wants to frame him up as allegations meant to Shore up support for a waning and egotistical C cause.  Lai who said the federal government will not be distracted by frivolous allegations made to divert attention from President Muhammadu Buhari’s achievements, disclosed this in a statement on Friday.  He informed that the Buhari administration is too busy trying to clear the mess of 16 years and build on its unprecedented achievements over the past three years.  Mohammed said that the ex-president’s “allegations” were meant to shore up support for a “waning and egotistical cause.”  Adding that while those who have skeletons in their wardrobes should be afraid, even of their own shadows, he urged innocent persons not to worry about any investigation, whether real or imagined.  The minister said it was curious that the frame-up and witch-hunt allegations came a day after a major presidential proclamation reversing some past acts of injustice was made, to the relief and acclamation of a long-expectant nation.  ”This administration will never engage in a frame-up of innocent citizens. That is neither in the character of President Muhammadu Buhari nor in that of his administration. Only the guilty should be worried. To paraphrase an African proverb, a man who has no wife cannot lose an inlaw to the cold hands of death.  ”The administration is also strongly committed to the tenets of democracy, including freedom of speech and the right to dissent. But we understand that those who, in their time, were untethered to those principles would find it hard to believe,” Mohammed said.
