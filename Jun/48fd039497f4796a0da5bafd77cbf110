By Sunday John Lafia   –    The Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Lafia branch, has vowed to expose corrupt judges and lawyers in Nasarawa State. Ishaka Dikko, NBA Chairman of Lafia branch, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lafia. Dikko said the association would expose any corrupt judges and lawyers in the state to ensure that the image of the judiciary was not tarnished. He said the bar would be firm in ensuring that bad eggs among them were exposed and brought to book. The chairman said that the association had received reports of lawyers influencing judgments through unlawful means. “It is no longer news that today in Nigeria some senior members of the bar and bench are being prosecuted with some of them convicted for influencing judgments through illegal means,” he added. Dikko, who decried the alarming rate of unethical conduct of lawyers in the state, added that some lawyers also engaged in fighting and squandering their client’s monies. He said that such attitude would not be tolerated among members because they were supposed to be the mirror of the society and last hope of the commonman. He advised members of the NBA indulging in the habit to desist before nemesis would catch up with them.
