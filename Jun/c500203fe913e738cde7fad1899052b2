By Yemi Adeleye Lagos –  A Lagos lawmaker, Mr Jude Idimogu, on Thursday said President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent to the “Not Too Young To Run Bill” had demonstrated that he meant well for youth.
Idimogu, representing Oshodi/Isolo Constituency II in the Lagos State House of Assembly made the assertion in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos.
According to him, signing the bill into law has laid to rest all issues around a statement credited to the President describing Nigerian youths as lazy.
“It is a good one, I am happy that the “Not too Young to Run bill” has been signed into law by the President.
“It is to tell Nigerians that the President is on ground and meant well for the youth. He made the promise on May 29 and fulfilled it in May 31.
“This shows that Buhari is up and doing, he wants the best for the youth irrespective of what the social media is saying about him,’’ he said.
Idimogu, who described the bill as popular, said it would impact greatly on the participation of young people in the decision-making process.
According to him, some of the hurdles preventing youths from actively participating in politics have been removed, youths have the zeal, strength and intellectual capacity to drive the country.
He urged the youth to make good use of the opportunities offered by the law to move the country forward.
