By Ibrahim Bello  Birnin Kebbi  –    Kebbi Government on Friday distributed relief materials worth over N50 million to physically-challenged and destitute in the 21 local government areas of the state. The Executive Secretary of the state’s Social Security Welfare Fund, Alhaji Nasiru Gwandu, made this known while sharing the materials to the 21 local government directors of social services in Birnin Kebbi. He said the relief materials distribution was aimed at giving the beneficiaries a sense of belonging and cushion the effects of some of their challenges. Gwandu explained that the distribution depended on the population of each local government area, adding that “100 tonnes of rice and 3,000 bundles of textile materials were distributed.” He urged the directors to ensure speedy and judicious distribution of the materials to the targeted persons in their areas.
