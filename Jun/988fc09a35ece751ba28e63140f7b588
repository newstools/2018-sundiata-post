By Mercy Osajiugo Minna –   The National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM) on Saturday advised Niger Government to bond nursing trainees to address the dearth of personnel in the state public health facilities. Mrs Ruth Adore, the Chairperson of the association, General Hospital, Minna Chapter, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Minna. Adore said that many nurses, after securing employment with the state government, relocated to other states to join their spouses or go for more juicy appointments. “This is one of the issues that we are contending with; a hospital with 100 nurses before now left with just 50 or less than that,” she said. Adore said that if nurses were bonded, it would prevent the dearth of nurses being experienced in the public hospitals. “I think if they are bonded for like 10 years, that will pay off for quality healthcare; it will also help the government to plan better. “In such a situation, the bonded will think before breaking the bond, knowing the legal implications of such an act. “The way out is for nursing trainees to be on bond; this, I think, will help address the problem of inadequate nurses. “A situation where nurses are employed today and leave after few months is not good enough for quality healthcare delivery,” Adore said. She, however, lauded the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) for the full accreditation granted the School of Midwifery, Minna, and the School of Nursing, Bida. (NAN)
