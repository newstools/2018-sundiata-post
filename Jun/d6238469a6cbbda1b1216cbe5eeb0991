By Nse Anthony-Uko :(Sundiata Post) — Guaranty Trust Bank (GTBank) has denied knowledge of the Supreme Court Order mandating it to pay the sum of N12 billion to Mr Innocent Chukwuma, Chairman, Innoson Group. The bank took to its official twitter handle @gtbank on Friday to address  its customers and the general public describing the alleged order as malicious and misleading. This is what it said,   “Recall that the Supreme Court of Nigeria on Thursday ordered the management of Guaranty Trust Bank to pay Innocent Chukwuma, chairman of Innoson Group a sum of N12 billion within 14 days. In a statement released on Thursday by Cornel Osigwe, Innoson Group’s head of corporate communications, the court struck the motion for stay of execution of the Enugu court of appeal division’s order that GT Bank pays N6 billion into an interest yielding account. The Supreme Court decision follows GTBanks motion for stay of execution at the Supreme Court when the Court of Appeal Enugu Division ruled on 9th Dec, 2014 that the appellant (GTB) is hereby ordered to pay the sum of Five Billion, Nine Hundred and thirty Six Million, One Hundred and Twenty Six Thousand, Two Hundred and Nineteen Naira, One Kobo (N5,936,126,219.01k) to the Deputy Chief Register of the Court within 14 days from the date of ruling and which the Deputy Chief Register shall pay same into an interest yielding account in a reputable bank other than Diamond Bank or Mainstreet Bank Plc pending the determination of this appeal. The money together with whatever accrues thereon shall be paid to the party who wi6ns the appeal.
