By EricJames Ochigbo   Abuja   –    A Bill for an Act to amend Federal Road Safety Commission Act to provide for establishment of a paramedic corps of the commission passed second reading at the House of Representatives on Tuesday. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Abubakar Ahmed (APC- Gombe) also seeks to make compulsory the use of child restraints in vehicles and resting periods for drivers travelling long distances. Leading the debate, Ahmed said that the provisions would reduce road accidents and fatalities on highways. He said that the bill when signed into law would also ensure the payment of all monies received by the commission into the Federation Account in accordance with section 162 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). In his contribution, Rep. Edward Pwajok (APC-Plateau) recalled that the introduction of the compulsory use of seatbelt by the commission reduced fatalities. He said that making rest periods compulsory for drivers travelling long distances would help to refresh them and reduce sleeping while driving. Pwajok said that most drivers only stopped to buy fuel which made them tired after a couple of hours on the highway. In his ruling, Speaker of the house, Mr Yakubu Dogara, refered the bill to the Committee on Federal Road Safety for further legislative action.
