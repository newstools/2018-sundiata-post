The General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the division, Maj.-Gen. Enobong Udoh, disclosed this to journalists at  a news conference at the division’s headquarters in Lagos. The  GOC was represented by the 35 Artillery Brigade Commander, Brig.-Gen. Olusegun Olatunde. “The 81 Division Nigerian Army in conjunction with some security agencies on May 30 at about 2:58 a.m.  intercepted three 5-ton trucks loaded with thousands of live cartridges,’’ he said. He said the trucks,  which were intercepted at  Balogun Village  on  Igbogila-Ilara road, Ogun,  State,  had  registration numbers Anambra  AAH 409 ZV, Lagos  BDG 782 XU and Lagos  GGF 88 XU. “The live cartridges in boxes and cartons were carefully concealed in a wooden platform with metallic plates,” he added. The GOC said that the drivers and their accomplices, on sighting the troops, abandoned their trucks and fled.

The GOC, who said the interception  followed  a tip off received from well meaning Nigerians,  thanked residents  of Lagos and Ogun for their continued cooperation.
