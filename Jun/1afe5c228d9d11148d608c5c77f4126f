By Akeem Abas Ibadan –  A group of medical professionals, Doctors’ Timeout Family (DTOF), has called on government, organisations and well-meaning individuals to support the needy and vulnerable in the society. Dr Anthony Ude, Founder and Convener of the group, made the call in Ibadan on Wednesday during a de-worming exercise to mark DTOF’s third year anniversary. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the group, which has its membership drawn from among medical doctors resident in Nigeria and overseas, was established in 2015. The group embarked on de-worming exercise at the I.M.G School, Oje Igosun and Jesus Children Mission Orphanage, Bodija in Ibadan, where several pupils received writing materials and were de-wormed. Ude stated that the organisation was formed to care for the needy, vulnerable and orphanage in the society, saying its greater challenge was funding. He stated that it would be a wonderful thing to see government, well-meaning organisations and individuals partnering DTOF towards achieving set goals. “We identify the remote and immediate needs of our people ranging from education, surgery to social amenities and provide for the needs. “We also sensitised the public on latest health issues such as Lassa fever. All these we see as part of our contribution to support the needy and society,’’ he said. Ude called on Nigerians to support efforts towards making life worthwhile for the needy and the vulnerable. The founder, who disclosed that the organisation sources its finances through donations from members and other Nigerians, said that it had since inception visited 14 states of the federation. “We have really imparted on so many lives since the NGO was founded here in Ibadan. “Our members in Port Harcourt, Nguru-Yobe, Enugu, Ilorin, Zaria and Ibadan, had at various times visited schools and orphanages to give health talk and distribute several materials to them,’’ he said.
