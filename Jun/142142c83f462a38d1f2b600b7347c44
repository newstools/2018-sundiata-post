First-half goals from Gary Cahill and captain Harry Kane helped England to victory at Wembley in their penultimate warm-up match before taking on Tunisia, Panama and Belgium in Group G in Russia. But the game was little of a true test for England, who benefited from a string of first-half errors by Nigeria. The Africans, who also head to Russia later this month, pulled a goal back through Alex Iwobi shortly after the break but threatened only fleetingly for much of the game. Southgate has yet to settle on his preferred starting XI and fielded Jesse Lingard alongside fellow attacking midfielder Dele Alli on Saturday, providing England with pace and creativity that led to a string of first-half chances. Wing-backs Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young added to Englandâ€™s attacking power, and with Jordan Henderson rested after his appearance for Liverpool in the Champions League final a week ago, Eric Dier looked confident as the holding player in midfield. Southgate will take comfort from the performance of Cahill, whose powerful headed goal from a corner after seven minutes will strengthen his claim for a place in the heart of defence. The Three Lions took control of the game in the 39th minute when Kane drilled a shot from the edge of the penalty area and Nigeria goalkeeper Francis Uzoho allowed it to squeeze past him. The Super Eagles will need to improve when they take on Croatia, Iceland and Argentina in World Cup Group D. England are due to finish their preparations for the tournament with a friendly against Costa Rica in Leeds on June 7, while Nigeria play Czech Republic in a friendly on June 6.
