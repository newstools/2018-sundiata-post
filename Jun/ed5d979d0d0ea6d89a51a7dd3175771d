By Moji Eniola Ikeja –  Peter Toluwabori, an alleged internet fraudster, was on Monday remanded at the Kirikiri Prisons in Lagos by an Ikeja Special Offences Court for allegedly destroying some evidence to be used by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Toluwabori, 26, whose address was not given, was remanded by Justice Mojisola Dada, following his “not-guilty’’ plea to a two-count charge of destroying evidence and aiding crime. “This case is adjourned until June 26 for trial and the defendant shall be remanded in prison custody,” Dada said. According to Mrs Zainab Ettu, the prosecuting counsel for the EFCC, the defendant committed the offence on April 10 in Ikeja, Lagos. “The defendant destroyed his android phone, an MTN SIM no. 08100994395 and a Globacom SIM no. 08073175280. “He willfully destroyed the items to avoid them being used as evidence against him in a judicial proceeding. “Toluwabori also aided one Peter Samuel who goes by the alias Daniel Johnson by receiving codes in his (Toluwabori’s) email address which is peter_olamide64@yahoo.com. “He forwarded the email address to Samuel to use via his (Samuel’s) email davey77@gmail.com to obtain money by false pretences,’’ she alleged. Ettu said the defendant committed the offences with Samuel, who is still at large. The offences contravened Sections 16(1) and 91(1) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2011. (NAN)
