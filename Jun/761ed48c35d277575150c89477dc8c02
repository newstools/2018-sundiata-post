Abuja (Sundiata Post)  –  Former governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, has sent his letter of resignation to the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state as he has concluded arrangement to go back to his former party,  the Labour Party.  It was gathered that the former governor, who joined the PDP in 2014 and later became the chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum, dumped the party following a disagreement between him and some national leaders of the party shortly after he left office as the governor in 2017.  In a letter addressed to the state leadership of the PDP on Wednesday, Mimiko said his decision to leave the party was personal to him. The letter reads in part, ” I hereby with utmost humility inform you of my decision to resign my membership of the PDP with effect from today, June 13, 2018, for some well-thought-out personal reasons.  ” It was an honour working with the many prominent Nigerians with whom I shared the PDP platform for the entire period I was in there as a member.  “Accept please the assurance of my very high regards.”  It was learnt that Mimiko would be joining the Labour Party he left in 2014, today in his hometown, Ondo, but without many of his aides who have remained in the PDP.  However, the State Chairman of the PDP, Mr. Clement Faboyede said Mimiko’s exit from the party would not have any negative impact on the party, saying the party was waxing stronger on a daily basis.  “Mimiko is a human being,  he has the right to his opinion, we have tried at all levels to discourage him but he insisted on leaving.  One thing I know is that PDP will not die as he (Mimiko) leaves.  We have survived many turbulent times in the past, so if he goes it cannot affect us negatively,” Faboyede declared.(Punch).
