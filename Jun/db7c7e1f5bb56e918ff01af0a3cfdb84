By Cecilia Ijuo Abuja –   The President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki says the Senate may amend existing security laws to effectively tackle security challenges facing the country. Saraki made this known at plenary on Thursday after about three hours of executive session with the National Security Adviser, Maj.-Gen. Mohammed Monguno (rtd). He said that the review of the existing laws was important to help security agencies in their operations. Besides, he said that Monguno had been asked to submit a funding request that would aid security agencies in their operations to the National Assembly for approval. He reiterated that the NSA was questioned on issues of terrorism, kidnapping, coordination of security agencies and killings generally in the country. “We directed that he submits a funding request similar to that of other security agencies in the country. “We also discussed that consideration for amendment to existing laws regarding security is important,” he said. Saraki said that the Monguno had apologised for his failure to appear on the first day of the invitation due to the clash of the invitation with the Federal Executive Council meeting. The Senate had earlier invited the heads of security and some para-military agencies following a motion sponsored by Sen. Suleiman Hunkunyi on the security situation in the country. Others invited to brief the Chamber were the Chief of Defence Staff, Inspector-General of Police, Comptroller-General of Nigeria Immigration Service, Director-General of the Department of State Services, and the Comptroller-General of the Nigeria Customs Service. The Chief of Defence Staff, General Abayomi Gabriel Olonisakin and the Director-General, Department of State Services (DSS), Lawal Daura, were physically present while others sent representatives.
