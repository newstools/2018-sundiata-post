By Joy Kaka‎  Abuja   –     A Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Thursday sentenced 24-year-old Sani Ibrahim to four months imprisonment for attempted theft. The judge, Abdulwahab Mohammed, who convicted Ibrahim, however, gave him N10, 000 option of fine and warned him to be of good behaviour. ‎ Ibrahim of Deidei, Abuja, was convicted on charges bordering on criminal trespass and attempt to steal, offences he admitted committing. The prosecutor, Babajide Olanipekun, had told the court that Ibrahim and others at large connived and trespassed into a compound at Deidei on Sept. 7. He said that Ibrahim, who was in possession of a knife, trespassed in an attempt to steal but was arrested, while his cohorts escaped. Olanipekun said that the offences contravened the provisions of Sections 79, 342 and 395 of the Penal Code.
