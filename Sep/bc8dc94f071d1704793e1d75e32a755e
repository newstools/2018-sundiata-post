By Habibu Harisu Sokoto –   The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar has charged members of the Anatomical Society of Nigeria on more enhanced methods of teaching anatomy education in the country. Abubakar made the call on Thursday in Sokoto when he received leaders and members of the association who paid him a courtesy visit. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that members of International Federation of Associations of Anatomy (IFAA) were in Sokoto for the 15th annual scientific conference and general meeting from Sept. 12 to Sept. 13. The conference was under the theme: ‘Re-designing the teaching of anatomy in Africa: Prospect and challenges’. Abubakar urged members of the association to embrace modern techniques in teaching the subject in tertiary institution in order to ease the challenges students face, which at times scared them off. The monarch also urged governments to supply modern equipment for the teaching of the subject in their respective higher institutions. The Sultan, who was appointed the grand patron of the association, also commended the members for the move so far made to make the subject entrepreneurial base and more competitive. He commended the IFAA members on their relentless efforts in ensuring the moribund Anatomy Act of 1933 was amended in tandem with modern challenges. Speaking earlier at the conference, the Guest Speaker and president of IFAA, Prof. Beverley Kramer, expressed gratitude to the Sultan for his continuous support and encouragement to the association and medical education, at large. In his remarks, the president of the Anatomical Society of Nigeria, Prof. Tamunotonye Jacks, said the association had taken proactive step to overhaul the B.Sc. Anatomy curriculum to reposition it for more competitiveness. (NAN)
