By Olawunmi Ashafa  Lagos –   The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), said the intervention of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) by revoking the license of Skye Bank licence was to ensure the safety of depositors’ funds. The corporation said this in a statement by the Head, Communications and Public Affairs Department, NDIC, Mr Mohammed Ibrahim, on Saturday in Lagos. It also urged depositors and customers of the defunct Skye Bank to continue to transact their businesses with Polaris Bank Ltd. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the CBN on Sept. 21, announced the revocation of the operating license of Skye Bank due to the inability of its shareholders to recapitalise it since 2016.
