By Toba Ajayi  Ilorin   –     An Ilorin-based legal practitioner, Mr Bashiru Ishola, on Wednesday advised Nigerians against divisive and inciting comments to ensure peace and unity in the country. Ishola said in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin, that the social fabric of Nigeria was being ruined with careless and unguarded statements by individuals and groups. According to him, most of the uprisings, tribal wars, religious crisis and ethnic clashes experienced in the past were due to intolerance, hate pronouncements and conducts, by leaders and citizens. “It is time for Nigerians to be mindful of their statements as the 2019 general elections are fast approaching. “Such statements should be guarded against not to cause unrest in the country especially from the politicians, religious leaders,” the legal practitioner said. He also advised media professionals to be mindful of their utterances and write ups to avoid misleading the public. Ishola stressed that all Nigerians must be mindful of the people they listen to and the statements they make in the social media. According to the lawyer, the strength of a nation lies in unity, not war.
