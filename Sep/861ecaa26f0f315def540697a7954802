By Victor Okoye  Abuja   –    Former Super Eagles winger, Finidi George, has congratulated the Super Eagles for their 3-0 win against Seychelles in Saturday’s 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying game at the Stade Linite, Victoria. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Gernot Rohr’s men took total control of the game from start to the end in spite of the poor state of the playing surface. Ahmed Musa broke the deadlock in the 15th minute when he unleashed a powerful shot from outside the penalty area that beat Seychelles goalkeeper Dave Mussard. Chidozie Awaziem added the second in the 34th minute slamming the ball home after Kelechi Iheanacho free kick came off the post, while Odion Ighalo got the third from spot-kick in the 56th minute. “Congrats Super Eagles…Keep soaring,” Finidi tweeted on his Twitter handle. Also, Rotherham United defender, Semi Ajayi, has said that he was honoured to make his international debut for Nigeria in Saturday’s 2019 AFCON qualifier clash against Seychelles in Victoria. He also noted that he was elated to see the Super Eagles record a win in the game. Ajayi, who once played for English Premier League club, Arsenal came in for the injured Chidozie Awaziem in the 74th minute of the encounter. He came close to grabbing an assist late in the game with fellow substitute Henry Onyekuru nearly hitting the target from his inch perfect cross. “Was an honour to make my international debut against Seychelles on Saturday. “Humbled to finally represent my country at the highest level and even more grateful to mark it with a win and clean sheet. “Thank you God#SuperEagles,” Ajayi tweeted on his Twitter handle on Sunday. NAN also reports that the Super Eagles will face Libya in their next 2019 AFCON qualifying game on Oct. 10 at home.
