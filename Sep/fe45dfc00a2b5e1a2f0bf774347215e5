By Awayi Kuje  Akun (Nasarawa State) –  Mr Jacob Ajegena-Kudu, an aspirant on the platform of  All Progressives Congress (APC) in Nasarawa State, has urged Nigerians not to vote for non performing politicians in the 2019 general elections.

Kudu, who is seeking election to represent Nassarawa Eggon Constituency at the state legislature, gave the advice on Saturday in a meeting with party stakeholders in Akun, Akun Development Area of the state. The aspirant also urged the people of the area to use their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) wisely by electing leaders of unquestionable characters. Also speaking, Mr Monday Nanza, a former Administrator of Akun Development Area, drummed support for President Muhammadu Buhari administration and that of Gov. Umaru Al-Makura, to enable them succeed in the task ahead of them. Earlier, Mr Malle Moses, the Deputy Chairman, APC of Nassarawa Eggon Local Government Area said the meeting was to unite members of the party ahead of the forthcoming primaries and general elections in the country. He advised members of the party to remain united and focused in order to ensure the victory of the party in the area, the state and the country at large. (NAN)
