By Adenike Omotoyinbo  Ikeja    –       A 42-year-old travel agent, Abimbola Bakare, was on Friday docked at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding one Goddey Okoh of N1.2million. Bakare had defrauded her victim on the pretext that she would procure a Canadian visa for him. The accused, who resides at No. 5, Joel Arubiewe St., in Mosan near Ipaja, Lagos State, is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and false pretences. The prosecutor, Sgt. Michael Unah, told the court that the accused committed the offences with others still at large on March 10, 2017 at 10.30 a. m. at his residence. Unah said the accused collected the N1.2million from the complainant with a promise that he would get a Canadian visa for him, a representation she knew was false. “All efforts made by the complainant to get back his money from the accused proved abortive,” he said. The prosecutor said that the offences violated Sections 314(3), 362(1)(b) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 314 prescribes a 15-year jail term for false pretences, while Section 287 stipulates seven years’ imprisonment for stealing. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. In his ruling, the chief magistrate, Mr A. A. Fashola, granted the accused bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. Fashola said the sureties should be gainfully employed and should show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until Nov. 19 for mention.
