By Chibuike  Nwabuko  Abuja (Sundiata Post)  –  The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, has informed  that Senator Godswill Akpabio’s political exodus will not halt his full investigation. Recall, that Akpabio who left office as Governor of Akwa Ibom State, in 2015, had been grilled on several occasions by the EFCC, over allegations of fraud. A Lawyer and Activist, Leo Ekpenyong, had petitioned the anti-graft Agency, accusing Akpabio of “devising a means of enriching himself, at the expense of the State”, while in office. Senator Akpabio who dumped Peoples Democratic Party and joined the All Progressives Congress, APC, in August, had said that the EFCC investigated and found nothing on him. He also dismissed the reports that he moved to the APC, because of the fear of being witch-hunted by the Commission. “Some people are saying I moved to APC, because a gun was pointed on my head. A young man wrote a petition against me, and the petition was filled with lies… I have never been charged to court… The EFCC did not find anything on me”, he had said at a rally in the Ikot Ekpene Area of the State. However, speaking during a parley with Editors, in Lagos, on Wednesday, Magu pointed out that Senator Godswill Akpabio is still being investigated over the accusations against him. He added that the fact that a Politician “jumps from one party to another, will not stop EFCC investigation; we do not stop investigation until it is concluded.” Responding to alleged interference by the ruling party, the anti-graft Czar said: “I am not the type you will ask to stop any investigation.” Meanwhile, Akpabio’s battle with the anti-graft Agency, began on October 16, 2015, when he was first invited for questioning, over an alleged N108 billion fraud.
