By Adenike Omotoyinbo  Ikeja,    –      An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Thursday remanded two persons for allegedly stealing their employer’s aluminum materials, valued at N3. 5 million. The accused persons, arraigned on a two-count charge of stealing, are Levi Chisom, 28, and Bukky Olisa, 38. The duo, reside at Arobaba Street in Egbeda, near Lagos and No. 7, Adealu St. in Dopemu, Lagos, respectively. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges and were remanded in Kirikiri Prisons due to their inability to meet their bail conditions. Chief Magistrate Mr A.A. Fashola, granted each of them bail in the sum of N300, 000 with two sureties in like sum. He ruled that the sureties should be gainfully employed and must show evidence of three years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. “The accused should remain in Kirikiri Prisons, pending when the bail conditions would be meant.” He adjourned the case until Nov. 26 for hearing. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Sgt. Michael Unah, told the court that the duo stole the aluminum materials, property of their employer, Mr Udoka Onweifendi. Unah alleged that the duo committed the offences sometime in 2017 at Aluminum Village in Dopemu. He told the court that the duo stole the aluminum materials kept in their custody at the company’s warehouse. The prosecutor said that the offences violated Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015.
