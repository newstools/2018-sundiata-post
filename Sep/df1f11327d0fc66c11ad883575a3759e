By Amen Gajira  Minna   –     A Minna Magistrates’ Court on Friday ordered the remand in prison custody of a 35-year-old driver, Liman Mohammed, for cheating. Mohammed was docked on a two count charge of criminal breach of trust and cheating, contrary to sections 312 and 322 of the penal code. The Police Prosecutor, Insp. Ahmed Ali, had told the court that one Mohammed Agaie of Gidan Mangoro arrested and brought the accused person to the station on Sept. 4. Ali quoted the complainant as alleging that sometimes in June 2018, one Bologi Ndakogi of Dutsen Kura, Minna entrusted the sum of N870,000 with the accused person for the purchase of a tractor. He said that the accused person neither bought the tractor nor refunded the said money to Ndakogi. When the charges were read to him, Mohammed pleaded guilty and begged the court for leniency. The prosecutor thereafter prayed the court to try him summarily in line with section 157 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The Presiding Magistrate, Sa’adatu Gambo, however, reserved sentence until Sept. 10.
