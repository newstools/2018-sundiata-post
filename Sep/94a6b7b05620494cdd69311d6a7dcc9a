By Zubairu Idris Katsina –  Prof. Armayau Bichi, the Acting Vice Chancellor, Federal University, Dutsin-ma in Katsina State, has urged Nigerians to continue to support the Federal Government’s fight against insurgency and corruption for the country to move forward. Bichi said this at a public lecture entitled: “Security Challenges in Growing Economy, Nigerian Perspective’’, in Dutsin-ma, Katsina State, on Monday. “Fight against insecurity and terrorism is fundamental and crucial in nation building, hence the need for all and sundry to continue to support the government to address the problem,’’ he said. He said the lecture was timely in view of the security challenges in the country and the need for the citizens to continue to support the government to tackle the problem. “The university will continue to organise lecture series on issues that will assist to promote peace and unity in the country at large,’’ he said. In his paper, retired Maj.-Gen. B T Obasa, said insecurity affects development of any nation. “Security and development are related, the imperative to maintain security affects other sectors like education, health, infrastructure which involve use of public funds. “Insecurity, therefore, becomes a drain on local and national resources at the expense of development and well being of the citizens,’’ Obasa said. He further observed that insecurity discourages investments by making a country unattractive to investors. Obasa identified loss of societal values, porosity of borders, unemployment, rural-urban drift and corruption, among others, as some of the factors responsible for insecurity in Nigeria. He urged governments at all levels to intensify efforts toward providing good leadership and continue to initiate policies and programmes that would improve the living condition of their people. He further urged the government to continue to adequately fund security agencies to enable them perform their functions effectively.  (NAN)
