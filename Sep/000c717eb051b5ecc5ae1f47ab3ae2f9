By Idris Olukoya  Epe     –     The Ogegbo of Ibonwon in Eredo Local Council Development Area in Epe, Lagos State, Oba Cajetan Adekoya, has appealed to the youth to exhibit and maintain peaceful conduct during and after the 2019 general elections. Adekoya gave the advice in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Epe, on Friday. He said that the advice became necessary because of the desperation of some politicians to get to power, and their use of youth for thuggery and violence in the past. “I pray for peaceful coexistence and harmony among political leaders in the country. “The youth should desist from being used as tools or for violence during the election. “Peace and orderliness should be upheld and maintained during and after elections,” the monarch said. Adekoya urged political leaders and those in positions of authority to work collectively for the progress of the nation. “Our leaders should put the love of the nation and citizens at heart as a matter of priority. “The country cannot move forward if everybody is doing divide and rule; cooperation should be the watchword, ” he said. The monarch urged the youth participate actively and vote for their preferred candidates in the 2019 general elections. “It is by your voting that your choice candidates will win the election. Let your votes count,” he said. Adekoya applauded Gov. Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos State for the massive infrastructure development done within the city, especially in Epe. “We, the people of Epe-Eredo community, are grateful for the infrastructure development and will implore you to do more. “The development within Lagos metropolis cannot be overemphasised; one good turn, they say, deserves another,” he said. Adekoya appealed to the Lagos State Government to build a modern palace for him, as the existing one is in bad condition.
