By David Adeoye Ajebo (Ogun ) –  Mrs Dolapo Dosunmu, the Oyo State Director of the National Orientation Agency(NOA), has called on women to provide effective parental care in order to promote youth development. Dosunmu made the call on Friday while delivering a lecture at the National Biennial Conference of Pastors Wives Ministers Fellowship organised by Foursquare Gospel Church, Ajebo, Ogun. The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that the theme of the lecture was: “ The Role of Women of Wisdom in Youth Development.’’ Dosunmu said that inadequate parental care topped the list of problems confronting youths in the country. ”This underscores the fact that a woman, who is the first parent a child recognises, occupies a critical position in the development of the child. ” Provision for the needs of children, education, protection, discipline, modelling and training–both spiritual, moral and home training– are the basic duties of mothers in the development of the youth, ” she said. Dosunmu urged mothers to monitor their children ’s behaviour and deal decisively with any form of deviant behaviour. She also admonished women to steer clear of immorality as children often emulate them. ”Restrain your children from associating with children of questionable character and teach them to do the right thing regardless of what other people may be doing. ”Find time for your children regardless of tight schedules and discipline them whenever they do or say anything bad. `’Do your best to supply the basic needs of your children even if their father is incapacitated,’’ she added. Mrs Olubisi Meduoye, the wife of the General Overseer of Foursquare Gospel Church, said the conference was an avenue to sensitise women on the need to play their maternal roles effectively. Meduoye said that youth development was a prerequisite for the growth of every nation. No fewer than 3,000 women from the 36 states of the federation attended the conference. (NAN)
