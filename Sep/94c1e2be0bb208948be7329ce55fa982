By Bosede Olufunmi  Kano   –      The Legal Aid Council of Nigeria on Thursday said it treated 31 cases in Kano State in August through its free legal services to those who could not afford to pay for such. The state Coordinator of the council, Alhaji Abubakar Umar, who made the disclosure in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano, said that 30 of the cases were civil matters, while the remaining one was criminal. According to him, some of the cases are still pending in court and that some of the civil cases were resolved out-of-court. He said most of the civil cases were on non-payment of pension and retirement benefits, mostly by privately-owned companies and pension fund administrators. Umar said others were on land disputes, marriage and debt recovery. “However, some of the criminal cases were on armed robbery, criminal breach of trust, homicide, rape and theft,” he said.
