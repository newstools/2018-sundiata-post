By Yakubu Uba  Yola –   A fake Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) official who identified himself as Simon Bolki, has been arrested on Tuesday in Adamawa House of Assembly while attempting to dupe the Majority Leader, Mr Hassan Barguma. Barguma told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the suspect approached him in his office with a fake EFCC identity card claiming to be from the Intelligence Unit of the commission. “When I called the name of my brother working with the EFCC in Abuja and other names of EFCC officials I know, he said he didn’t know them. “I then called my brother in EFCC and liked them together while placing the phone on speaker,” he said. Barguma said during the chat between his brother and the suspect, the suspect could not provide convincing answers. “My brother then pronounced him as an impostor and from there he started pleading with me. “He said he was a university graduate and that it was lack of job that pushed him into the act. “I had to intervene to prevent people from lynching him while we awaited the arrival of police who took him to the state CID,” he said. Also speaking on the incident, the Information Officer of the assembly, Mr Mohammed Daji, said that the suspect was first sighted on Monday in the premises of the assembly trying to approach lawmakers. “One of the lawmakers even gave him appointment for Tuesday,” Daji said. The Acting Public Relations Officer of the Police Command in Adamawa, DSP Habibu Musa, confirmed the incident. “We have so far arrested two suspects and investigation is ongoing,” Musa said.  (NAN)
