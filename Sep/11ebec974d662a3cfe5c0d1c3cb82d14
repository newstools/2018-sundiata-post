By Egbogota Clara  Lagos   –     The Director of Social Communications, Catholic Archdiocese of Lagos, Msgr. Gabriel Osu, has urged Nigerians, especially youths of voting age, to participate actively in politics, as 2019 approaches. Osu, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday, urged youths to get actively involved by voting and offering themselves for elective positions in the country’s polity. “Our young people should use the opportunities presented by the National Assembly on the Not-Too-Young-To-Run bill by contesting in the forthcoming election, and participate in other electoral processes. “We should not be swayed by the various inducements and empty promises we were used to in the past,’’ he said. The cleric urged Nigerians not to vote based on ethnic, religious or regional sentiments, but to rather vote for credible leaders. “This is the time to vote on past records of public service. Let us not vote for those that will run the country aground. “This country has competent and wise persons who can navigate Nigeria to the Promised Land,’’ he said. The cleric, who frowned at the rate at which politicians were defecting from one party to another, said it was unfortunate and unhealthy
for the country. “It is very unfortunate that is the kind of politics being played out in this country, it cannot take us anywhere, and it is not good for our country. “It is disheartening; it cannot take us to the greater future that we are looking ahead to,’’ he said.
