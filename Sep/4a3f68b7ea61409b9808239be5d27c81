By Abiodun Azi  Asaba,   –    The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Delta registered 600,000 new prospective voters during the just-concluded Continuous Voters Registration {CVR}. INEC’s Administrative Secretary in the state, Mrs Rose Orianrian-Anthony, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria {NAN} in Asaba on Tuesday. Orianrian-Anthony said that the commission achieved a lot by giving the electorate who had not registered before the opportunity to register to obtain their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs).
She said that the ne registrants included those who recently relocated to the state from other parts of the country.
Orianrian-Anthony said that those whose data were wrongly captured were corrected. She said that registering for PVC during CVR was a civil responsibility that all Nigerians should cherish. She said that the CVR was worth the stress and the commission was duly committed to the exercise. The Administrative Secretary also said that the commission in the state distributed 36,647 old PVCs as at Aug.25 while 137,719 PVCs were yet to be collected. She said that collection was a bit low in the state and that was why the commission kept sensitising the electorate to come forward for them.
Orianrian-Anthony also advised the disabled and women to be part of the registration.
She said that INEC would continue to do its best to ensure that the votes cast by voters during elections counted.
Orianrian-Anthony said that the process would be accessible to all Nigerians irrespective of age, gender and religion.
She said that the field would be free and fair that nobody would be left out.
