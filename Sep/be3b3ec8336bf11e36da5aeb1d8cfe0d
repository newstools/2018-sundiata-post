The three committees for the competition tagged, “Kwara 2018”are the Publicity Committee, Mobilization, Venues and Contact Committee as well as Technical Committee. Alalade, who is the Chairman of the Main Organising Committee (MOC) for the competition, while inaugurating the sub-committees charged them to build positively on the successes recorded in the first edition and also address the challenges observed. While commending JAMB for the second time opportunity, he pointed out that the feat achieved in the maiden edition occassioned the consideration to host the second, adding that Kwara had the potential and manpower to always do it right. He also commended the state government led by Alhaji Abdulfatah Ahmed for providing the enabling environment and support for sports and youth development in the state and Nigeria. The members of the three committees were drawn from the MOC and other football stakeholders in Nigeria, and the sub-committees, according to him, are reduced to three to curb wastage and ensure effectiveness. He added that the MOC had earlier concretised agreement with the University of Ilorin and Kwara Football Academy on the hosting of the competition as well met with the leadership of the Joint Steering Committee for Sports Development in higher institutions, comprising NUGA, NIPOGA and NICEGA, on the way forward. The competition has tentatively been fixed for the first week of October this year.
