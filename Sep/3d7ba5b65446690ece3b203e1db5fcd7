By Aisha Cole Lagos  –   Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) would soon sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with United Arab Shipping Line to train 100 Nigerian cadets for free within five-years. The Director General of NIMASA, Dr Dakuku Peterside, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Lagos. “The United Arab Shipping Line knows that Nigerian cadets are knowledgeable and will also help to build their seafarers. “United Arab Emirates had purchased ships and they need crew onboard the vessel. That is why they are willing to train Nigerian cadets to boost their shipping crew. “NIMASA had also placed 298 cadets onboard the United Kingdom and Egypt ocean-going vessels to engage the cadets on sea time training,” Peterside said. He said that the agency was also working closely with some indigenous ship owners on the possibility of placing some cadets on their vessels to enable them have sea time experience. Peterside said that 1,880 certificates were authenticated for stakeholders in the last one year, compared to 113 certificates verified in 2016 to boost shipping business in the country. (NAN)
