By Ige Adekunle  Sango-Ota (Ogun) –  The Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) said on Saturday that one person died while three others sustained injuries in an accident involving a Mercedes Benz bus and a tricycle on Idiroko Road, in Ogun. Mr Adekunle Ajibade, the Unit Commander of TRACE in Sango-Ota, confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun. He said that the accident happened at about 8.45 p.m. on Friday. Ajibade explained that the Mercedes Benz bus with registration number APP 555 XE was heading toward Oju-Ore lost control, as result of brake failure, while speeding. He said it was the alleged recklessness of the driver (who ran away) that caused the vehicle to ram into a tricycle marked AGL 563 QE. The TRACE official said that the bus fell on the tricycle which resulted in injuries to four persons who were on board the tricycle. Ajibade also said the crash led to the death of one passenger, while three others sustained various degrees of injuries. “The corpse of the victim has been deposited at the mortuary of the General Hospital, Ota, while the injured are also receiving intensive treatment at the same hospital,’’ he said. According to him, the driver of the bus alighted from the fallen truck and absconded after the accident but the police are on his trail. He said that TRACE and other security agents, like the Nigerian Navy, and the FRSC quickly joined sympathisers to rescue the injured and rushed them to the hospital. (NAN)
