By Salisu Sani-Idris Aso-Pada (Nasarawa State) –   A non-governmental organisation, SayProve Empowerment Foundation, has trained 800 youths on different skills at Aso-Pada District in Karu LGA of Nasarawa State.
The foundation’s Chairman, Chief Stephen Chukinujekwe , said at the graduation ceremony on Saturday that the training would address youth restiveness.
He said that the foundation was determined to minimise the rate at which youths got involved in crimes, by engaging them in meaningful economic ventures.
“This free skill acquisition for youths of this area is part of our efforts to reduce youth idleness and crime rate.
“The era of waiting for white-collar jobs is over; government alone cannot create the needed jobs for our teaming graduates; so, entrepreneurship and skill acquisition are vital,” he said.
The chairman said that the organisation spent over N1 million on the training, and urged other non-governmental organisations and well-meaning individuals to also support the youth.
He said that his foundation would continue to render such an assistance to the youth, particularly those desirous of self-reliance.
Earlier, Pastor Anietie Okon, the General Coordinator of the foundation, said that the beneficiaries were trained on photography, cosmetic, painting, paint production, bead making, and bag making, among other skills.
Okon said that the foundation had a team of professionals in each of the fields who trained the participants.
He advised them to make maximum use of the knowledge they gained to become great.
Mr Shamu John, the district’s Youth Leader, thanked the foundation for the gesture, and advised the beneficiaries `not to disappoint the community’.
Some beneficiaries, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), promised to put the knowledge they acquired into proper use. (NAN)
