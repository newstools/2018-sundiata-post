By Peter Amine  Jos   –     Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau has expressed deep sadness over the death of his Director of Press and Public Affairs (DOPPA), Mr Emmanuel Nanle. Mr Yakubu Dati, Commissioner for Information and Communication, in a statement on Wednesday, described the death of Nanle as shocking. According to Lalong, Nanle, passed away on Monday evening in an Indian hospital where he was receiving treatment. Lalong said the deceased was a committed patriot who pursued his beliefs with uncommon zeal. “The late Nanle was not only a close ally but a pillar of my administration as he worked consciously for the success of the `Rescue Administration’. “The late Nanle braved all odds in 2014 and tirelessly worked for the success of the APC in Plateau in the 2015 general elections,” he said. The governor said that he and his government would surely miss the deceased, especially at this time when his services were most needed. He explained that though painful, it was the will of God and asked the family and people of the state to be comforted by the Lord Almighty. Lalong said arrangements would be made to bring the remains of Nanle home for a befitting burial. Meanwhile, a condolence register has been opened for sympathisers at the Government House and at the Ministry of Information and Communication.
