By Moronke Boboye  Lagos   –      A 51-year-old businessman, Dauda Adeleye, who allegedly defrauded a man of N27.1million, was on Wednesday docked at an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court. The accused who resides at 29, Oshola St. in Arepo, Ogun, is being tried for fraud and obtaining under false pretences. The prosecutor, Insp.

Akeem said that the complainant, Mr Pelumi Fawehinmi, who wanted some plots of land for farming, was introduced to the accused as an estate agent. “The accused took the complainant to a nine-plot- of-land property and they both agreed on N27.1 million as the total package after negotiation. “The complainant paid N13.6million into the account of the accused. “The complainant also gave his two cars which valued as N13.5 million to the accused to sell to make up the amount agreed by them,” he said. Akeem said that the complainant realised that the property belonged to the government when he took some labourers there to work. “Since then, all efforts to locate the whereabouts of the accused had been unsuccessful. “However, the complainant successfully sighted the accused a few weeks ago and had to shout for help,” he said. Akeem said that the accused was apprehended and was brought to the police station. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015{Revised}. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges.
