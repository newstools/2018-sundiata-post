By Ugochi Ugochukwu  Abuja   –       An FCT Magistrates’ Court, Lugbe, on Tuesday sentenced a 20-year-old labourer, Loli Limsa, to nine months imprisonment for attempting to steal a woman’s property.
The court sentenced Limsa of Tundun-Wada village, Lugbe, after he pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of criminal trespass and attempt to commit theft.
Limas had begged the court for leniency after admitting committing the crime.
The Magistrate, Mr Idharhi Samuel, said that the convict had saved the court the pains of prolonged prosecution and he is also a first time offender. Samuel said that the convict has no criminal record, and therefore gave him N7, 000 option of fine. The magistrate also warned the convict to be of good behaviour and to desist from committing crimes after serving out his punishment.
Earlier, the prosecutor, Mrs Ukoha Ndidi, had told the court that on Sept 4, one Fatima Wali of No. 45, New Site Extension, Lugbe, Abuja, reported the incident at the Lugbe Police Station. Ndidi alleged that the convict criminally and intentionally trespassed into the complainant’s house without her consent and attempted to steal her property. The prosecutor told the court that the convict was arrested immediately.
She said the offences contravened Sections 348 and 289 of the Penal Code.
