By Perpetua Onuegbu Abuja –  Mr Emeka Stanley, former Deputy Speaker, Abia House of Assembly, says restructuring of Nigeria’s political and economic structures will enhance unity and development of the country. Stanley said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja. He said the agitation for restructuring among the various social and political groups in Nigeria arose out of citizens’ perceived low level of political and economic development. The former deputy speaker, who is currently aspiring to become a Senator representing Abia South Senatorial District on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), canvassed for equity and justice. According to him, a system where there is no real legislation, justice and equity, people are bound to be complaining, this is why Nigerians are calling for restructuring. “Restructuring does not mean disintegrating the country, it is giving better recognition to regional existence, equity in appointments and distribution of resources. “I believe in restructuring and other reforms that can make Nigeria to become a strong country with good future for its people in terms of employment, industrialisation and economic development. “On insecurity, restructuring will give room for state policing so that each state can police its territory without resorting to the federal police. “Restructuring will go a long way to reduce the burden of the Federal Government in the areas of works and transportation, education, and health among others.’’ Stanley said he had been involved in act of law making for Abia and had all the experience to do a better job at the federal level. “So, I have the required experience to become a senator at the upper chamber of the National Assembly. “I have already indicated my interest by taking the form,’’ the aspirant said.
