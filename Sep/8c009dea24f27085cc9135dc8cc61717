By Dada Ahmed  Abuja –   The Imam of Area 10 Juma’ah Mosque, Abuja, Alhaji Yahya Garbaal-Yoalwi, has appealed to youths in the country to shun all forms of violence and be law abiding. The imam, who made the appeal in Abuja during his sermon, said “let’s shun political and tribal violence by all means. “Reprisal attacks and taking law into our hands is not Islamic and can lead only to more harm and trouble to the entire nation,’’ he said. He also called on the generality of Muslim Ummah to eschew disunity, reminding them “Ummah’’ in Islam means “the community of believers.’’ According to the cleric, Islam considers all Muslims brothers and sisters in a community with common objectives of worshipping Allah and adherence to the five pillars of Islam. The cleric advised the congregation to see the concept of Ummah as a challenge to unite, irrespective of sects, locality, race, and language among other divisive expressions. Referring to the Holy Quran, Garbaal-Yoalwi, said “we have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know each other.’’ “A believer’s relationship to the other believer is like that of the different parts of a building, each of which supports the other.’’ According to him, all the traditions of Islam point to the fact that all Muslims are brothers and are like a single body and can never be indifferent toward one another. He said there should be “spirit of cooperation, brotherhood, fraternity, good will, love, sympathy, and unity of direction and purpose’’ among Muslims.  (NAN)
