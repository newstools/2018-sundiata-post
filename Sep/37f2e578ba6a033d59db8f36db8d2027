By Stanley Nwanosike Enugu   –       A Chieftain of All Progressive Congress (APC), Sen. Ayogu Eze, has assured Nigerians that the party would surely deliver on promises to revamp the economy.
Eze gave the assurance to a mammoth crowd of indigenes of Enugu State that came to receive him at the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu, on Saturday.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the crowd of about 15,000 people came to receive him was falling over each other to have a glimpse of him, carrying placards with inscription urging Eze to contest the state’s governorship seat. He noted that APC would reposition the economy of the nation to favour all Nigerians, irrespective of social, economic status and sex, at the same time.
“I am overwhelmed with the population that I see in this airport today to welcome me; this shows that our people wanted change.
“I will assure you that the APC government will never disappoint you and will revamp the economy to better your lots,’’ he said. Eze said that he came back from his oversea trip to reconcile the party faithful.
“APC must remain one united and indivisible family in Enugu state and that is what I will achieve first,’’ he said.
NAN also reports that all the APC supporters followed Eze in a motorcade to his Enugu residence.
NAN gathered that Eze, who contested for governorship under the PDP in 2015, would likely vie for the governorship seat of the state on the platform of the APC.
