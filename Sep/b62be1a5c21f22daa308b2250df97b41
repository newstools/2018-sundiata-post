By Shuaibu Tatu  Bagudu    –     Kebbi Governor, Atiku Bagudu, on Sunday commended Ganten Fadama community in Bagudo Local Government Area for their effort in safeguarding the lives of three elephants that strayed into the village. Bagudu who made the commendation when he visited the community, said such animals must be protected to ensure balance in the ecosystem. ”My visit is to encourage and appreciate the good people of Kebbi, particularly the Ganten Fadama community for safeguarding the lives of the elephants that invaded the community. “And also to extent President Muhammadu Buhari’s appreciation to the people on their untiring effort of ensuring the security of the wild animal,”he said. Bagudu urged all communities in the state to continue to provide information and support until the animals return to their rightful location. The governor, however, warned the general public against illegal killing of wild animals, adding that,” whosoever inflicts an injury to the animals will face the wrath of the law accordingly. ” The leader of the community, Alhaji Muhammadu Bello, explained that the elephants were first sighted at Zaria Kala Kala village in koko/Besse Local Government Area on August 28, before migrating to their village on August 31. “The three elephants are suspected to have come from Benin Republic, as we have no such wild animals in our community,” he said. Also speaking a member of the community, Malam Dantallo Ganten, explained that he saw the two other elephants grazing across the river in Labana rice farm. ”Our worry is not only that the elephants were grazing on our farms, but of that people trooping in to see the animals are also destroying crops on our farms,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) had earlier reported that the three elephants were first sighted at Zaria Kala-Kala village on August 28, and local officials had to prevent residents from killing them.
