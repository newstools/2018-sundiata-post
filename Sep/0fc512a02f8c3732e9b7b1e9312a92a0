By Stanley Nwanosike  Enugu –   The Police Command in Enugu State has arrested a three-man gang of armed robbery suspects that specialises in dispossessing people of their valuables on Udi-Ozalla-Four Corner Road near Enugu. The police also recovered one cut to size single barrel gun and a stolen motorcycle from the suspects. The spokesman of the command, SP Ebere Amaraizu, in a statement in Enugu on Saturday, said the suspects were nabbed on Sept. 5. Amaraizu said that the feat was achieved by the operatives of Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) Enugu State Command. “The suspects had conspired and robbed an Okada rider of his motorcycle at gun-point on Aug. 28 along Udi-Ozalla-Four Corner Road, having posed as passengers and unknown to the owner that they are armed robbers. “They later escaped to an unknown destination; but following intelligence information, all the suspects were arrested. “One of the suspects, Ikechukwu Emenike, revealed that he needed to get a motorcycle to convert as a tricycle and to be giving Ugochukwu Esom some money for settlement for assisting him and the person that gave them the gun.” Amaraizu said a full scale investigation had commenced on the matter while the suspects had been helping police operatives in their investigation.
