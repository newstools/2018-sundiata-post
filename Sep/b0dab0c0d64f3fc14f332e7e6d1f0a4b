By Bridget Ikyado  Makurdi      –      The Tor Tiv, Prof. James Ayatse, has cautioned youths against using social media platforms to insult and abuse elders because of political differences.
The Tor Tiv gave the advice in an oration during a special thanksgiving service in honour of Sen., Barnabas Gemade, on his 70th birthday celebration.
He said it was unfortunate and saddening the manner in which youths used social media platforms to insult elders without remorse.
“It has gotten so bad that even traditional rulers and kings are not left out in youth disrespect and mischief.’’
According to him, social media platforms are meant to accelerate development now that the world has been reduced to a global village.
Ayatse noted that such abuses and unguarded comments could bring about disunity and misunderstanding among people.
He stressed that all religions emphasised morality and abhorred indiscipline.
” Anyone who disrespects his elders will die, the Bible states it. The authorities warn and punish such acts; there is no room and it is unacceptable to disrespect your elders and those in authority, ” he said.
Some dignitaries at the ceremony were the President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, Sen. Dino Melayi, Gov. Benedict Ayade of Cross Rives and Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue.
In their respective speeches, the dignitaries prayed for longer life, good health and elevation for Gemade and for peace to reign in Benue and Nigeria.
