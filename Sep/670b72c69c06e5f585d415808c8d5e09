By Ibrahim Bello  Birnin Kebbi    –     Kebbi Governor, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, on Tuesday warned that he would sanction contractors who failed to adhere to job specifications. ‘‘I will not tolerate poor execution of work from any contractor,” he said. Bagudu gave the warning in Birnin Kebbi in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Alhaji Abubakar Dakingari. He issued the warning after he received a complain from the Emir of Zuru, Alhaji Muhammadu Sami on the poor execution of Zuru township roads by the contractors. Bagudu also faulted the state engineers for poor monitoring of ongoing projects across the state and warned them to live up to their responsibilities. The governor appealed to communities to always report erring contractors to his office for appropriate action. “My administration is constructing 367 kilometres of road network throughout the state, with Sakaba- Dan-Kolo Road in Zuru Emirate as the longest. “I am not happy about the rehabilitation of Maga-Ribah Road where the government expended more than N500 million but portholes have started resurfacing,” he said.
