By Idris Olukoya  Epe   –      The Lagos State-owned Michael Otedola College of Primary Education, Epe, has
spent N100 million to upgrade its facilities, the college’s Provost, Dr Nosiru Onibon, has said. He said the upgrade became necessary to create a conducive teaching and learning environment in the school. “The college management has so far spent N100 million to rebuild a collapsed building, erected a new structure and
upgrade toilet facilities among others,” Onibon told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Epe on Tuesday. NAN reports that Onibon was appointed on Jan. 2 by the Lagos State Government as the provost of the college named after
the late governor of the state, Sir Michael Otedola, who hailed from Epe. In addition, the provost said the management provided free WiFi in the library and offices as well as repaired
operational vehicles. He said the intervention was as a result of the decrepit condition of the buildings in the college when he took over. Onibon said: “We sourced for loan to fund the projects because the condition of the school buildings was not attractive. “They needed urgent repairs and that was why we have to quickly look for money to upgrade the facilities to an acceptable
standard.” He expressed the hope that the new environment would boost students’ academic performance.
