By Joshua Oladipo  Ilesa    –       The Action Democratic Party (ADP) in Osun on Saturday held its mega rally in Ilesa ahead of the gubernatorial election on Sept. 22. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the campaign took place at Ilesa Central Praying ground amid tight security and a large turnout of supporters. The party’s gubernatorial candidate, Alhaji Moshood Adeoti, assured workers of prompt payment of salaries and pensions. Adeoti also said the party would review the programmes of the present administration under Gov. Rauf Aregbesola if elected as governor. According to him, policies that would improve the lives of the people would be introduced while those inimical would be scrapped. ” We will not be self-centred in party decisions but rather comply with the party’s dictates, especially on the growth of the state,” Adeoti said. The ADP state Chairman, Mr Olalekan Akinola, presented the party’s flag to the gubernatorial candidate, urging the electorate to support the party and Adeoti. NAN reports that a former Commissioner for Finance, Dr Bolorunduro Wale, and a former Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Mr Sunday Akere, were among the ADP chieftains at the forum. Adeoti, the immediate past Secretary to the State Government, had resigned to contest the governorship election.
