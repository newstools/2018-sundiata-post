By Stanley Nwanosike   Enugu   –    The Voice from the East (VEAST), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), has called for a coalition between Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) and NGOs to tackle the rising cases of rape and incest against the girl-child in the society. “The CSOs and NGOs should form a coalition in order to have a concerted ground to tackle this rising rape and incest menace in order to ensure that the girl-child is protected both in the families and the society.” The Convener of VEAST, Kindness Jonah, made the call while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Enugu. According to Jonah, the spate of rape and incest committed against the girl-child was becoming alarming in the society. He said perpetrators of such offences be given life sentences. “From Biblical times, incest and rape have received condemnation and can never be tolerated in our society anymore,’’ he added.
