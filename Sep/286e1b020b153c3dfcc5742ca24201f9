By – Emmanuel Mogbede Abuja –   Alhaji Aliyu Umar, a governorship aspirant in All Progressives Congress (APC) in Taraba, has advised the Federal Government to set up special committees to end incessant land disputes. Umar gave the advice on Thursday in Abuja while speaking with newsmen after submitting his Expression of Interest and Nomination Form to contest in the state governorship election in 2019. He said such committee if organised in communities across the country would put a stop to land disputes through constant dialogues. Umar said that he would work to unite the people of the state if voted in as governor. He said that constant dialogues by stakeholders would go a long way in nipping all issues of land disputes in the bud. “I have worked all my life in places where I have done negotiations and reconciliation. I have worked in the land division of Gongola State where I started work. “And you know that anything that involves land, involves a lot of people, I have been an administrator of land in Gongola State in the past. “Then I came to Taraba with the same experience, from there I went to National Boundary Commission and I did the same thing, “ he said According to Umar, what the country needs now at the moment is for people to come together and work as a team. The governorship aspirant said he was persuaded to join politics, adding that his desire was driven by passion for justice, fair play and equity. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that over 10 aspirants in Taraba had bought the APC Expression of Interest and Nomination Forms to contest in the 2019 governorship election. Among them are the Minister of Women Affairs, Hajia Ashia Alhasan, and Boboyo Kagiama.  (NAN)
