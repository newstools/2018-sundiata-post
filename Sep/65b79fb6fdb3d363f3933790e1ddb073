(Sundiata Post) — Organised labour led by the Vice President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Amaechi Asugwuni on Thursday shut down the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, secretariat and banks branches, which ignored the ongoing warning strike over National Minimum Wage. Some members of the organised labour had earlier gone round all government agencies located at Alausa Secretariat in Lagos to ensure that workers complied with the strike action by labour. Labour leaders and their members went round to stop activities at branches of Access Bank, Stanbic IBTC, and Guaranty Trust Bank, and workers of the banks were sent out of the premises of the banks. The labour leaders also drove workers at the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) out of the premises of the parastatal. Comrade Amechi Asugwuni in an interview with LEADERSHIP, said that he was satisfied with the level of compliance with the strike action by workers. When asked why owners and drivers of commercial buses failed to comply with the action, he said that they had been directed to stop operation. According to him, we are going round to enforce the strike and we will do everything legitimate to ensure that it stands, adding that nothing can be more proper than the action taken by the worker’s union. Comrade Asugwuni explained that they were still waiting for the Federal Government to call them for a meeting, adding that they informed Nigerian workers to stay at home until labour says otherwise. President of the Association of Senior Staff of Banks Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI), Comrade Oyinkan Olasanoye and his team also joined other labour leaders to ensure that banks comply with the directive on strike action.
