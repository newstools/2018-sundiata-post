By Taiye Elebiyo-Edeni  Abuja   –     The Nigeria Institute for Transport Technology (NITT) says it is establishing its Outreach Learning Centre in each of the six geo-political zone, which will be completed in 2018. Alhaji Aminu Yusuf, Director-General of the institute, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja. He said that three new institute centres are being located in Gombe, Kano and Ebonyi, adding that other centres in Zaria, Lagos and Port Harcourt had already been completed. He said that the six geo-political zones would now have a centre each. According to him, the establishment of the three new centres is approved by the institute and with the 2018 appropriation. “Our outreach learning centres are 50 per cent completed because we started the projects since 2017; we have three centres before and now we added three new centres in the three states. “The new centres was birth following the approval of the organisation, to expand our outreach in order to meet the demand of the institute. “Part of the demand is that every zone should have an outreach learning centre. “Abuja will be taken care of by the North Central, which is also ongoing and we intend to complete it this year.” Yusuf emphasised on the need to train the transport officials as the sector was a very dynamic discipline. He said that the staff required adequate training and retraining for effective service delivery of the service sector. He, however, said the institute was committed to ensure that it meets the current transport challenges by introducing more programmes that would benefit the industry. The director-general told NAN that the organisation was hoping for a greater success in 2018 as the institute`s headquarters office located in Abuja would soon be completed.
