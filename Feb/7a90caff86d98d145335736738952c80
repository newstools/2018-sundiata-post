CAPE TOWN  – South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s new cabinet was a transitional one to take country to next elections due mid-2019, he told reporters in parliament on Tuesday, after Monday night’s cabinet reshuffle. “It’s a cabinet that takes into account the various strengths we’ve got in government. … I‘m hoping and believing that they will take us forward.” When asked if he had to make compromises, Ramaphosa said: “No, no, no. This is a transitional cabinet that is going to take us to the next elections.”(Reuters)
