By Okeoghene Akubuike  Nasarawa   –     Malam Adamu Adamu, Minister of Education, said on Tuesday that the quality of teachers produced by teacher education institutions and their classroom performance had been adjudged unsatisfactory. ‎ Adamu, said this in his address at a two-day Stakeholders retreat/workshop organised by th‎e Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria(TRCN) in Akwanga, Nasarawa.
‎
‎The News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN) reports that the workshop has the theme ‘ RoadMap For Teachers Professionalism and Quality Education in Nigeria. Adamu, r‎epresented by Alhaji Muhammed Karage, Director, Basic and Secondary Education, Ministry of Education‎ stressed the need to address teacher professionalism now to save the profession from total collapse. The minister said the theme of the retreat was timely considering the present state of the economy and the need to reposition teacher professionalism in Nigeria‎. “It has been said times without number that no educational system can rise above its teachers. “Hence, teacher professionalism issues have to be addressed now to save the profession from total collapse. “Teacher education encompasees both the first form of professional training that prospective teachers receive and the continous professional development of serving teachers,”‎ he said. Adamu said that the roadmap to be developed would serve as a compass for realising the goals of teacher professionalism in Nigeria. ‎ The minster said that the quality of teachers produced by teacher education institutions and their classroom performance was unsatisfactory. ‎ He said using students’ performance as a proxy measure of teacher quality, the results of the current monitoring of learning achievement at which performance of pupils was below 50 per cent in literacy, numeracy and life skills, shows the poor quality of teaching. Adamu listed some of the challenges facing teacher education in Nigeria to include low quality of entrants into pre-service training; failure of the College and Faculties of Education to match teacher supply with demand and inadequate funding of teacher education. He listed others to include bad teaching practice and implementation; and non-implementaion of the national teacher education policy; poor remuneration of teachers and non-implementation of teachers salary. ‎ Adamu said that the Ministry would ensure that all the 151 Colleges of Education and 200 National Teachers Institute study centres keyed into the teacher education reforms to enhance professionalism. He added that the ministry through the TRCN would also ensure that the 29 NCE curricular are updated regularly, and also ensure the launch of the National Teachers Education Policy. The minister explained that the government would also ensure the improvement of the quality of teachers through consistent teacher professional development. ‎ Gov. Tanko Al-Makura, in his remarks, pledged the state government support to continue to train and re-train teachers in the state.
‎
Al-Makura, represented by Mr Aliyu Ahmed, Commissioner for Education, Nassarawa state, stressed the need to improve the welfare of teachers. He added that teachers should enjoy all the benefits that other professions enjoyed in order to restore the dignity of the profession.
‎
” Teaching has now become a profession for those who cannot get a job and this must not be so; we must ensure we employ competent and qualified people‎ to teach or else we will still be going round in circles. ”
‎
He noted that such retreats should include primary and secondary school teachers, especially from the rural areas in order to have a holistic view.
