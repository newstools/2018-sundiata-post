“If I tell you say I love you oh, my money, my body na your own oh” once you sing this line to any Nigerian, you are almost certain to get a reply of “30 billion for the account e yo.” This is how popular the song ‘if’ by Davido has gotten – but the question is, how much is Davido worth? Does he have the self acclaimed 30 billion naira in his account?  We will be looking the artiste Davido and how much the Omo Baba olowo is worth, comparing his net worth with Manchester United star Juan Mata. Sounds interesting right? Well for starters, Davido is an outstanding musician and his real name is David Adedeji Adeleke. He is a great and versatile artiste and record producer who has been doing as much as he can to increase the development of the Nigerian musical industry.  The 25-year-old came into great eminence apparently in 2011 when he stormed the music industry with his hit single Dami Duro – a song he solely produced. The hit single was received by a massive audience within and outside Nigeria, and soon, it gave the pop star one of the significant musical awards in Africa to widen his musical ambit and further strengthen his presence in the industry. It has become known that Davido net worth was approximately $16m (N5.7bn) at the end of 2016. Davido’s songs gain more than 10m views on YouTube. His songs are the main income, but, as any other famous person, Adedeji Adeleke has additional proceeds. He signs profitable contracts with record groups and performs at their concerts.  Manchester United midfielder, Juan Mata has an estimated net worth of $63.4m ( N22.8bn.) he is not even worth up to the N30bn, Davido boast about, but from all indications he is richer than the musician. Mata transferred to Chelsea in 2011 after his four-year stint with the Valencia. He led the team in clinching the UEFA Champion League and UEFA Europa League title in 2011-12 and 2012-13 respectively. After his successful run with the Chelsea, he agreed to move to Manchester United in 2014.
