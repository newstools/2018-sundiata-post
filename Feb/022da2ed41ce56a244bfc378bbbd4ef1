Big Brother Naija 2018 housemate, Cee-c, has said she was surprised seeing herself easily put up for eviction by her former strategic partner, Tobi. Becoming the Head of House, HoH, for the third time, Tobi had the power to save a pair of partners from eviction while replacing them with another pair. To the shock of fellow housemates and viewers, Tobi saved the pair of Leo and Bambam and replaced them with Lolu and Cee-c. Apart from being Tobi’s ex-strategic partner, Cee-c is also his romantic partner. Speaking with Big Brother yesterday evening, Cee-c, who has become the most controversial housemate, said, “Tobi shocked me. Sincerely I never expected it after all we shared. “It’s true we were having issues at that point but to put me and my strategic partner up for eviction was something I never expected. “I wasn’t myself through out yesterday. But that is in the past now. He has explained why he did it and I have moved on.”
