ABUJA (Sundiata Post) I am 100% in support of the position of NEC of APC on the tenure of elected executives. The decision will not cure the sickness. It will only postpone the doomsday. It however affords party leaders and managers the opportunity to go back to the drawing board and work out a potent anti implosion remedy. It’s too late to go for an elective congress now. Such a congress will fatally damage the party beyond redemption. The decision of NEC cured the madness of Rochas in Imo state and other states. In Imo state, we can conclusively deal with the arrogant Rochas politically. His, is a story for another day. President Buhari’s interest wasn’t going to be served by the two contending forces prior to the decision of NEC. Admittedly, he aligned with the lesser evil and of course he will face the consequence. Aligning against Tinubu was the only option available to him. He has to now work on his strategy on how to manage the situation. The South West gave him 2.43m votes in 2015. He won the national election by 2.5m votes against Jonathan. Assuming that political lightweights have been empowered to challenge Tinubu in the zone, the best they can command is 50% of the last vote delivered to Buhari. This implies that 1.22m votes will be lost to the opposition if Tinubu is not managed. The inference here is that Buhari will lose his 2.5m advantage before the first ballot is cast. There is a development from Sokoto and Zamfara axis and and the implication will be huge. North Central is already lost completely. Don’t forget that despite the popularity of Buhari in 2015, he still lost Nasarawa state. Buhari has no more route to the presidency. I repeat that his decision to back Oyegun was the best for him considering the prevailing scenarios. Unfortunately, the road to political perdition commenced before then and it’s now irreversible.
