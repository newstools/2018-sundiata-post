Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Wife of the Vice President’s, Dolapo Osinbajo and Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State have called on Nigerians to pray for the safe return of the 110 girls abducted by Boko Haram insurgents from Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, last Monday.
They made the call while speaking at the opening ceremony of a two-day conference of Osun Officials’ Wives Association (OSUNWA) tagged: “Virtuous Woman: Pushing for greater development.” Osinbajo said Nigerians should realise the need to be their brother’s keepers, especially by praying for the safe return of the missing girls. The VP’s wife pointed out that kidnappers, too, have mothers, sisters and possibly daughters, and should not put fellow mothers, sisters and daughters of other people in undue panic and sorrows by kidnapping innocent girls.
On his part, Aregbesola called on the participants to observe a one-minute prayer for the prompt safe release of the abducted girls. He said, “We need to ask God to touch the hearts of the insurgents to hasten the release of the girls and other victims that have been in their captivity. “Women are central to life, they are guarantors and caretakers of the human race
