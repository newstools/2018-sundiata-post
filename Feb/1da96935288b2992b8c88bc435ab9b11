Igbaugba Ehigimetor  Benin   –     The Green Party of Nigeria (GPN) said on Tuesday that the reordering of the 2019 elections timetable by the National Assembly would lead to unnecessary huge financial burden on the country. The party’s Chairman in Edo, Mr Roy Oribhabor, said in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin that the GNP was seriously bothered about the move by the legislators. He also said that the GNP would back holding the elections in one day. “We are seriously bothered about the logistics problem and the financial implications of this legislative action considering the hard situation in Nigeria today,” Oribhabor said. He said rather than re-ordering the elections, NASS should explore the possibilities of fixing all the elections to hold in one day. “We have listened to all arguments for and against the reordering, but they all lacked the direct solution to our political problems, I therefore called on NASS to use its legislative power to fix the election for one day. “It is on record that the 1979 general elections were held in one day and the system gave room for total political participation by all parties, the electorates were able to choose their candidates of interest. “We are convinced beyond reasonable doubts that, when all elections are held in one day, the system will give room for more parties to win. “Therefore, GPN support one day election because the advantages are superb, it reduces cost, encourage total participation and gives room for more political space,’’ Oribhabor said. He advised NASS to make it a legislative duty to make laws not targeted at individuals but for the goods of Nigeria and Nigerians.
