According to the minister, the committee is responsible for ensuring that financial services are rendered in such ways and manners that protect the environment from externalities. “We must not fail to acknowledge the fact that Nigeria is endowed with abundant natural and human resource, which we can adequately and efficiently harness to strengthen our public finance. “Consequently, I implore you to take innovative and pragmatic steps to facilitate, encourage and support activities which would impact the nation economically and socially,’’ she said. Responding on behalf of the committee, the Chairman, Mrs Olubunmi Siyanbola said the committee would ensure the success of the NSF project. This, she noted the committee would do by ensuring that only economically friendly projects were undertaken going forward. “We appreciate the initiative of integrating the financial services sector in the fight to sustain our socio-economic environment. “We wish to assure you that we will sacrifice our talents, time and treasure for this laudable project as we strive to achieve our mandate,’’ she said.
