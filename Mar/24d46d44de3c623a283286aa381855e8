By Nse Anthony-Uko (Sundiata Post) — The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) is to investigate some banks for the inadequate rendition of returns to the corporation on instances of fraud, forgeries, and cases involving members of their staff who were either dismissed or had their appointments terminated on grounds of fraudulent activities. According to the head of communication Mr. Mohamed Ibrahim, the corporation made the decision in the light of the most recent report from its off-site supervision of the DMBs which revealed the number of fraud cases attributed to internal abuse by staff of banks increased from 231 in 2016, to 320 in 2017, or 38.53 per cent above the figure reported for the previous year. The report relied on a total of 286 responses received from 26 banks during the period. The 286 responses received from banks in 2017 cited 26,182 cases of fraud and forgeries which is 56.30 per cent higher compared to 16,751 cases reported in 2016. Similarly, the amount involved in the fraudulent activities documented increased by ₦3.33 billion from the ₦8.68 billion reported in 2016 to ₦12.01 billion in 2017 or 38 per cent. However, the actual loss slightly decreased by ₦24.42 million or 1.03 per cent from ₦2.39 billion in 2016 to ₦2.37 billion in 2017. Internet or online-banking and ATM or card-related fraud-types reported constituted 24,266 or 92.68 per cent of all the reported cases, resulting in ₦1.51 billion or 63.66 per cent of losses in the industry in 2017. The report also documented other miscellaneous crimes such as fraudulent transfers or withdrawals, cash suppression, unauthorized credits, fraudulent conversion of cheques, diversion of customer deposits, diversion of bank charges, presentation of forged or stolen-cheques among others. The 22 Licensed Commercial Banks and 4 Merchant banks rendered 286 returns on dismissed staff as a result of fraud and forgeries during the year under review. Out of the 26,182 fraud cases reported by the 26 licensed banks, 320 cases were attributable to internal collaboration by bank staff. A total of 320 bank employees had their appointments either terminated or were summarily dismissed in 2017, as against 231 in 2016. That represented an increase of 38.53 per cent in the total number of fraud cases reported in 2017. However, the losses arising from the reported cases decreased from ₦760 million in 2016 to ₦682 million or about 11.43 per cent in 2017.
