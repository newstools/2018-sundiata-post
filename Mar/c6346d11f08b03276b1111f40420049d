By Stanley Nwanosike  Enugu   –    The Enugu State Traditional Rulers’ Council has appealed to their subjects to comply in the ongoing immunisation of children against measles in the state. The Chairman of the council, Igwe Lawrence Agubuzu, made the appeal while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday. Agubuzu said that the council had directed monarchs to assist health officials to ensure 100 per cent compliance in their domain. NAN reports that the state government is targeting to immunize 500,034 children between the age of nine months and five years from March 13 to March 25. According to Agubuzu, the monarchs have been fully mobilised and had directed that no child should be left out in the exercise. The council chairman lauded Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for the exercise, adding that the coverage of the exercise was unprecedented in the history of the state. “The attention paid to immunization in the past was not of this magnitude. Besides, the governor has made the necessary provisions for a hitch-free exercise. “Little wonder Gov. Ugwuanyi has been adjudged the “Most Mother and Child Friendly Governor in the country,’’ he said.
