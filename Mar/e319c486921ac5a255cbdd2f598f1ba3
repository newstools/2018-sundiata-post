Paris   –   French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said prisoners sentenced to less than six months in jail will be able to serve their time outside of prison under a reform plan laid out by his government. Report says Macron, who is looking on how to curb overfilled prisons, envisages the use of electronic monitoring in such cases. “In addition, sentences of a month or less would no longer be allowed. “They don’t do anything,’’ the French leader said in the south-western French commune of Agen. Each year, some 10,000 people in France are given sentences of less than a month, while 80,000 are sentenced to between one and six months. These sentences are generally given for traffic offences, robbery or drug use. According to earlier statement, many prisons in France exceed their capacity, especially those in the Paris region.
