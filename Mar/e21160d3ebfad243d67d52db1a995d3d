The Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo state has alleged that the governor is planning to rig the next election in favour of his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu. The PDP raised the allegation against the backdrop of comments credited to Governor Rochas Okorocha, in which he was reported to have said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will control the state government for the next 24 years without any break. Addressing a press conference at the party’s secretariat in Owerri yesterday, the state Chairman of PDP, Charles Ezekwem, claimed that the party had learnt of the plot and was ready for the governor. Ezekwem said, “We have it on good authority that the APC in Imo state is working assiduously on how to subvert the will of Imo people in 2019, having become very unpopular because of its gross maladministration and record of monumental corruption. “It’s only hope now lies in rigging elections but that cannot happen again. The PDP will put in place a watertight anti-rigging formula that will shock the APC leaders in 2019.”
