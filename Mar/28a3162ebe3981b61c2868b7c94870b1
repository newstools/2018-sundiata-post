Former Big Brother Naija 2017 housemate and Singer Jon Ogah has revealed why he sees BBNaija 2018 housemate, Nina as the winner of N45m. Ogah in a post on his Twitter page said Nina’s ways of handling situations in the house had distinguished her. He applauded her for maintaining calmness in the house despite gossip and provocations from housemates. This is following her refusal to insult and exchange words with Cee-c during a heated argument on Monday night.
Cee-c called Nina all sorts of names on Monday night after she accused her of being a cheat over sharing of food. Ogah defending Nina tweeted “I haven’t really spoken about Nina proper since #BBNaija began. I realized that she has a very calm way of handling situations. “She has a mind of her own, so even when people gossip others, she is distinguished. “Regardless of anything, I see her as a winner.”
