ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Northern Nigeria, a once monolithic political structure, is now a fissiparous entity, fatally divided against itself. Inordinate greed for power, disregard for equity as a component of democracy, fed by the majoritarian logic that “equity is not equality” have dealt a fatal blow to the once formidably united Arewa. We have set on fire the principles of justice and non discrimination which Sir Ahmadu Bello lived for. In fact, he now shakes in his grave over the fate that has befallen Arewa. On a second thought, I tend to see TY Danjuma’s controversial statement as a reflection of the mood of a man who found himself at the nadir of despair at a point everyone is losing hope in the troubled political marriage called Nigeria.
