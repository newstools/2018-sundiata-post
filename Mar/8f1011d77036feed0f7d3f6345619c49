Barcelona (Spain)   –     Lionel Messi scored two brilliant goals and created another for Ousmane Dembele as Barcelona thrashed Chelsea 3-0 on Wednesday to reach the Champions League quarter-finals 4-1 on aggregate. Messi opened the scoring after two minutes and eight seconds, the quickest goal of his career, slipping the ball through Thibaut Courtois’ legs from a tight angle. The Argentine forward created the second with a blistering run from the halfway line which left three Chelsea defenders stumbling in his wake. Messi then squared the ball for Ousmane Dembele to rifle home his first goal for the club. Marcos Alonso hit the post and Olivier Giroud was unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty for a tangle with Gerard Pique as Chelsea tried to launch a comeback. However, Messi killed the tie with his 100th Champions League goal. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said after the match: “Tonight in the two legs, Lionel Messi made the difference. We are talking about the best player in the world. “Over the two legs we were a bit unlucky. We hit the post four times. In our best moment today they scored. “They were very clinical. We created many chances. We are talking about a player (Messi) that every season he scores 60 goals. “We are talking not about a top player but a super top player. He made the difference. “We have no regrets. I must be pleased for the commitment. They gave everything tonight. We didn’t deserve to lose 3-0. “During the game, from the bench and for me it was a clear penalty on Marcos Alonso. We have to go and move on and to prepare for the game against Leicester on Sunday.”
