By Kingsley Okoye and Funmilayo Adeyemi  Abuja   –     Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has called for better internal democracy in the nation’s political system. Ikpeazu made the call in Abuja on the News Agency of Nigeria Forum, while responding to questions on perceived non-adoption of internal democracy in the conduct of primary elections by political parties. He stressed the need for all political parties to insist on the adoption of internal democracy mechanism in the conduct of party elections in the country. “Even when politicians say we want internal democracy, they are coming with their own agenda. “The internal democracy is to the extent that you allow them to impose their own choice; so they say it is not internal democracy because what they planned did not work (out). “I support internal democracy and I think every party, not even PDP should insist on internal democracy. “But in seeking internal democracy, let us also know that people are entitled to their opinion; they can scheme, they can plan, they can arrange. “I liken politics to a game of soccer; you cannot stop people from pushing you, but you have a choice on where you want to fall and how you want to fall.’’ On some PDP elders, who left the party, Ikpezu said it was their choice to make. “Life is about choices. If they are still looking for greener pastures, so be it; if they are looking for grey pastures, so be it, “A party is a dynamic organisation, and indeed, it can be likened to an organism; it responds to stimulus and it grows and it can die. “So, if those elders have moved on, I wish we can have 10 youths to replace them; whether it will affect the fortunes of the party going forward will be determined by Nigerians. “Whatever be the case, time will tell.’’
