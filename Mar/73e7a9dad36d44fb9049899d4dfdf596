By Aledare Akinwale Lokoja –  Students in Kogi have commended the state government for reviewing their bursary allowance by 400 per cent. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that students from the state in tertiary institutions, who used to collect N5,000 as their annual bursary allowance, will soon collect N25,000. NAN reports that the review took effect from the 2017/2018 academic session. Mr Yahaya Adeiza, National President, Okene Students Union, who spoke on the review, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Lokoja, described the increment as “wonderful”. “Gov Yahaya Bello deserves commendation for increasing our allowances. His action will encourage us to read harder,” he said. He particularly noted that the allowances had not been paid over the past years, and hailed Bello for resuscitating and reviewing it upward. “The review is a huge step that students will cerebrate for a very long time,” he said. He, however, appealed to the governor to ensure transparency in the disbursement. “Some mischievous workers and politicians are always out to hijack such laudable gestures and mess them up. We want the governor to pay close attention to the disbursement process,” he said. Adeiza assured the governor of constant support, and urged him to sustain policies aimed at improving the living standards of the poor.
