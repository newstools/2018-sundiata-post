By Abiemwense Moru Abuja –  The Bill seeking upgrade of Federal Polytechnic, Auchi, to a university on Thursday passed second reading at the House of Representatives. The sponsor of the Bill, Rep. Johnson Oghuma (Edo-APC), said when passed, the Bill would reduce the number of prospective undergraduates in Nigeria. Oghuma said that the bill would achieve global standards where polytechnics were being converted to universities to bridge the gap and harmonize standards of tertiary education. “In developed nation’s like America and United Kingdom, most polytechnics have been converted to universities of technology and helped to upgrade education generally.” He added that the measure was also to achieve one of the set goals of government of upgrading education standards in science, engineering and technological training in the country. Another aim, according to him, will be to provide the much-needed space for post-graduate studies which no polytechnic provides. The lawmaker disclosed that as currently placed, Auchi Polytechnic had all it took in terms of manpower and facilities, to take off as a full-fledged university. He also said that youths from that catchment area would now have a place to go and study to meet their various lifetime aspirations previously denied them due to quota and catchment policy in the country. The bill was subsequently passed by members when it was put to a voice vote by the Speaker, Mr Yakubu Dogara. The bill was later referred to the Committee on Tertiary Education Services for further action.
