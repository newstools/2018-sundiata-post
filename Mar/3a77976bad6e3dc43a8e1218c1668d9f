By Ibironke Ariyo Abuja –   The Prisoners Rehabilitation and Welfare Action (PRAWA) an NGO has called on the media to support the ongoing prisons reform in the country. Its Executive Director, Dr Uju Agomoh, made the call at a news conference in Abuja on  Thursday. Agomoh emphasised the need for media to join hands with Federal Government and its partners in efforts at reforming the nation’s institutions. She said “I want to urge the media to solicit the rehabilitation of prisons and social development of prisoners. “The public needs to understand that they also need to support prison reform. “That is the more reason the media is important and the engagement today is to deepen our collaboration and partnership.;; Agomoh said without strong partnership of the media, the prison reform effort could not yield the desired results. She explained that the NGO was looking forward to creating a rehabilitation village that would create jobs for prison inmates. Established in 1994, PRAWA is an NGO aimed at promoting security, justice and development in Africa. In 1998, the organisation secured observer status with African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. (NAN)
