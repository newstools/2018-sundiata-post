By Yakubu Uba Yola –  A total of 50 youths, mostly Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in Adamawa, have completed entrepreneurship training organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Speaking at the graduation ceremony in Yola, the Country Director of UNDP, Dr Samuel Bwalya, represented by Dr Robert Asugwa, the Team Leader, said the training was part of UNDP’s intervention in promoting development. Bwalya said such programme of training people to be employable handled by UNDP had been successful in many states. He cited Lagos where he said companies had been employing such trainees. “For us to develop we need entrepreneurship development and that is the essence of this training,” he said. He tasked the trainees on challenges they would face at the initial stage of their businesses and urged them not to hesitate in seeking help and information which he said, were key to progress. “We will monitor you to find out how you are doing; the challenges you are facing or the progress you are making,” the country director said. The Executive Secretary of Adamawa State Emergency Management Agency (ADSEMA), Mr Haruna Furo, lauded UNDP for the gesture and urged the beneficiaries to make maximum use of the training in order to improve their lives. He reiterated the commitment of the State Government to continue to collaborate with UNDP and other stakeholders in job creation, particularly for those willing to be self employed. Speaking of behalf of the graduating trainees, Jimmy Elot, thanked UNDP for giving them hope and a lifeline to build a future. “We will make sure that the resources expended on our training are not wasted,” Elot said.
