Abuja （Sundiata Post）-  Chief of staff to Governor Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo, Alhaji Ahmed Yayari, was yesterday arrested by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) When the news of the arrest filtered round Gombe state yesterday, there was jubilation in some parts of the town.  The head of operations of the EFCC Gombe zonal office, Johnson Babalola who confirmed the arrest, said the arrest is part of a probe into alleged misuse of the 2015 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign funds. “Yes, we invited Yayari among others to our office. We are still investigating the matter,” he said in a phone chat on Friday.  Babalola, who said that the governor’s chief of staff was invited to ascertain his alleged involvement in the disbursement and diversion of the campaign funds, said the anti-graft agency would prosecute anyone found wanting once investigations are concluded.  The arrest of Yayari, who is said to be eyeing the 2019 gubernatorial seat, was greeted with jubilation by residents of the state capital who accused the PDP of impoverishing the state.  As soon as the news spread some residents and civil Servants gathered in groups, mostly in market places and government offices discussing the matter, describing it as a welcome development.  A level 10 officer who refused to disclose his name for fear of victimisation said the arrest of the chief of staff by the EFCC is a welcome development as it will serve as deterrent to others. According to him, “the arrest of the chief of staff by the EFCC is long overdue.  Many of us in Gombe, especially in the civil service are very happy with the development. We are the ones in charge of pushing files and we know what transpired during the elections and what is transpiring.”  “I am calling on the EFCC to intensify their investigation and ensure that all those that looted funds meant for Nigerians or the people of Gombe are force to pay back or go to jail.” He said.
