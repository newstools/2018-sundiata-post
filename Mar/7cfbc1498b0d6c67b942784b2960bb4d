Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi will welcome guest to the event before President Buhari will be invited to present his opening remarks. Meanwhile, the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the state government to explain its decision to declare Thursday as  work-free. In a statement by Hakeem Balogun, spokesman of the PDP in the state, the party criticised the action of the state government and also, accused the Ambode administration of attempting to lure workers to welcome the president. “Despite the unsolicited holiday, the Lagos state government is lobbying the reluctant civil servant of Lagos state to welcome President Muhammdu Buhari to Lagos state,” the statement read. “Governor Ambode is trying to cover up the fact that Lagosians and the civil servants no longer the federal and state governments.” The party said having abandoned the state since his emergence in 2015, the president is using the visit as an avenue to reconcile with Tinubu, a former governor of the state.
