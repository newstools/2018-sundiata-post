Mogadishu   –    The U.S. military said Wednesday its special forces conducted an airstrike against Al-Shabaab terrorists in southern Somalia on Monday, killing two militants and wounding three others. The U.S. Africa Command (Africom) said the airstrike which was conducted in cooperation with Somali government near Mubaarak region also destroyed a vehicle “In coordination with the Federal Government of Somalia, U.S. forces conducted an airstrike against Al-Shabaab on the morning of March 19 near Mubaarak, Somalia, killing two terrorists, wounding three terrorists, and destroying one vehicle,” Africom said in a statement. The U.S. forces alongside Somali and African Union forces have increased ground and air offensives against the militant group Al-Shabaab in the last few months. The U.S. forces vowed to continue using all authorized and appropriate measures to protect U.S. citizens and to disable terrorist threats. “This includes partnering with AMISOM and Somali National Security Forces in combined counterterrorism operations and targeting terrorists, their training camps, and their safe havens throughout Somalia and the region,” Africom said. The latest U.S. strike comes amid heightened vigilance by Somalia’s stabilisation security unit forces who have launched operation targeting the northern parts of Mogadishu, in response to the increasing terror attacks in the Horn of Africa nation.
