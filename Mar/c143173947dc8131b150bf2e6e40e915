Moscow    –      President Vladimir Putin has a deep understanding of Russia’s issues, sees
solutions for them and is highly motivated by this process in his work, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov
told the RT broadcaster. “He’s got a huge understanding of what to do to make this country better. And he sees better than anyone in
this country the scope of the problems,” Peskov said. He said Putin knows what problems different Russian regions have, and what issues people in different job sectors and
walks of life are facing. “But at the same time he understands what can be the way of solving these problems. And I can feel it working next
to him that it’s a huge drive for himself combined with sense of responsibility. “This is a great chance for our country and a great challenge for himself,” Peskov explained. Asked if, in his opinion, the president had ever wished to retire, the spokesman said that he did not think Putin
had ever expressed a desire to leave his post. Peskov described his own job as “an unbelievable experience, an unprecedented experience.” “I can hardly imagine any other position in this world that brings such an experience to you,” the spokesman said. Peskov has served as the presidential press secretary since 2012. Previously, he had served as Putin’s spokesman
between 2008-2012, when the latter held the office of prime minister.
