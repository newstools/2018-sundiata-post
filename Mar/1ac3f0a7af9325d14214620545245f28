By Taiye Agbaje Abuja –   Mr Adebayo Shittu, the Minister of Communications, says there is the need to commercialise locally manufactured products to inspire inventors in the country. Shittu said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at the just-concluded 2018 Technology and Innovation Expo organised by the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology in Abuja. The expo tagged: “Fast Tracking Sustainable Development of Nigeria Thorough Science and Technology”. According to Shittu, everything that is invented must be commercialised so that the brilliant ideas behind it can be rewarded for their efforts. “Well, we congratulate ourselves as Nigerians for the wonderful exposition that we just experienced, a lot of new innovative ideas in technology have been exhibited. ‘’So there must be commercialisation that will give impetus and inspiration to other people to also involve in new products,” he said. The minister congratulated the ministry who organised the expo as well as Nigerians, adding that the expo showcased a lot of talents the country was endowed with. ‘’It is our hope that next year, subsequent year will be better organised and many more participants will get involved,” he remarked.
