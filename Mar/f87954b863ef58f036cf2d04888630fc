  Nigerians on Twitter are reacting to the decision by Big Brother to return two out of the 11 already evicted housemates into the Big Brother Naija 2018 house.  Last night during the live eviction show, the host Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, informed viewers that they will be voting to bring back two of the evicted housemates who will also be competing for the N45m prize.  The two Housemates with the highest scores will be allowed back into the House. However, Nigerians on twitter are protesting Big Brother’s decision. Some Nigerians are of the opinion that the ‘new” housemates will negatively affect the chances of their favourite housemate winning.  Even music producer, Don Jazzy didn’t agree with the decision to bring back evicted housemates.
