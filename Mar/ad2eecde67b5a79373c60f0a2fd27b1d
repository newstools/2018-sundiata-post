By Emmanuel Mogbede Abuja –  Alhaji Ado Dogwa, the Chief Whip of the House of Representatives says President Muhammadu Buhari has no choice than to re-contest in 2019 if Nigerians want him to. Dogwa dropped this hint while speaking with newsmen on Wednesday in Abuja, adding that the All Progressives Congress (APC) was already strategising on how to win the election. “I can beat my chest and say that with the commitment we have gotten so far from major stakeholders across the country, the APC remains the party to beat. “We are battle ready for 2019 to get back to Aso Villa with Buhari as our president, in addition with the governors. We are going to add some states to the existing ones,’’ he said. The lawmaker said that critical decisions had been reached at the just concluded party caucus and National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting in Abuja. “NEC as the highest decision-making organ of the party discussed critical issues and plotted important strategies for the major elections next year. “We also discussed important issues bothering on how to improve the lots of our party and reconcile aggrieved members as well as ensure the security of lives and properties in the country,’’ he said. When asked if the APC had an alternative should Buhari decline contesting the presidency in 2019, he said: “he cannot try that. “Tell Buhari that he cannot try to contemplate not accepting the desire of Nigerians to re-contest in 2019. “Quote me, I Ado Dogo, the Chief Whip of the House of Representatives will whip him to line if he refuses to contest,’’ he said.
