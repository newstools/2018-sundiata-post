A video of former Big Brother Naija housemates, Leo and Khole mocking Alex have been trending online, Khole could be seen in the video mimicking Alex the way she was crying when Leo and his strategic partner Ifu Ennada left the house. When Leo was evicted on Sunday during the live eviction show it was a sad moment for Leo’s former strategic Alex who couldn’t stop crying for a while because she was really saddened by his eviction.    On Sunday Alex actually angered viewers of the Big Brother Naija show when she was crying for Leo and they aired their views on social media. According to some comments, Alex shouldn’t have cried, it would have been better if she just replaced herself with one of the evicted pair. The duo nicknamed ‘Lifu’ were evicted this Sunday, ending their quest for the N45million star prize pegged on the reality TV show tagged Double Wahala.
