By Kingsley Okoye and Funmilayo Adeyemi “Even when politicians say we want internal democracy, they are coming with their own agenda. “The internal democracy is to the extent that you allow them to impose their own choice; so, they say it is not internal democracy because what they plan did not work. “So, what I want to say is that I support internal democracy and I think Ekiti will insist on internal democracy. I think every party, not even PDP alone, should insist on internal democracy. “But, in seeking internal democracy, let us also know that people are entitled to their opinion; they can scheme, they can plan, they can arrange, they can even say something. “I liken politics to a game of soccer, a contact game. You cannot stop people from pushing you, but you have a choice on where you want to fall and how you want to fall. On some PDP elders, who left the party, Ikpezu said it was their choice to make decisions for themselves. “Life is about choices; if they are still looking for greener pastures as people will say, so be it. If they are looking for grey pastures, so be it. ’’Political party is an organisation that is in a state of rapid floss. It is a dynamic organisation, and indeed, it can be liken to an organism, it responds to stimulus and it grows and it can die. “So, if some people, especially those elders, have moved on, I wish we can have 10 youths to replace them so that we can add image to the party. ”But, whether it will affect the fortune of the party going forward, that will  be determined by Nigerians, but whatever will be the case, time will tell,” he said.
