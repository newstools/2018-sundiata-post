ABUJA (Sundiata Post) The reason Lagos State increased the Land Use Charge is because it wants to raise revenue because there is so much to be done. Good argument. The boss of the Lagos Inland Revenue Service said the target is N750b per annum. Again, good idea. I have been writing on this for ages: Lagos is the most corrupt state in the country. How? You see projects but you NEVER get to know the cost of execution. I have access to information: the level of project inflation in our state is not only criminal but ungodly. How much did Abule Egba bridge cost? What of Lekki-Ajah flyover? Was there any open bid for the Pen Cinema own? How much did Mile12-Ikorodu extension cost? How much did Lekki Link Bridge cost? I can go on and on. Any governor in Lagos must perform because you cannot be charging people for the air they breathe and don’t perform. But that is not the issue. I challenge any one to a debate on this: IF SEVENTY PERCENT OF MONEY LAGOS MAKES IS SPENT ON THE STATE, WE WON’T HAVE ANY UNTARRED ROAD IN THE STATE! I challenge anyone to contradict this and I get my structural engineer friend to make his paper public and you would be shocked. You cannot be celebrating projects without people knowing what they (the projects) cost them. It is public funds for Christ’s sake! WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW IS THAT YOU MIGHT BE CELEBRATING ONE ROAD THAT WAS DONE AT THE COST OF FIVE! Lack of accountability on managing public funds is WORSE than direct stealing of such funds!
