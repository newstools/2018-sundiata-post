Mexico City  –    British oil major, BP, will drill its first deep water exploration well at a block it operates in the southern Gulf of Mexico during the third-quarter of 2020, according to a plan approved by Mexican oil regulator, NH. The four-year exploration plan for the block, located in the Gulf’s Salina Basin, is expected to lead to an investment of 199.5 million dollars and add up to 75 million barrels of oil equivalent in reserves, according to NH. Norway’s Statoil and France’s Total are equity partners in the BP-led consortium, which won the development rights to the block in Mexico’s first-ever deep water oil auction in late 2016.
