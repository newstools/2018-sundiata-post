Abuja （Sundiata Post）- The Labour Party (LP) has denied being part of a meeting with a former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, a former Governor of Kano State, Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, and 35 other political parties in Lagos ahead of the 2019 general elections.  LP National Publicity Secretary, Ebere Ifendu, in a statement yesterday in Abuja, said the report indicating the party was part of the 35 political parties at the “purported meeting” was false and without substance.  Ifendu said, “As a party held in trust for the generality of the people of this great country, it is important for us to quickly debunk this falsehood and set the records straight.  “We categorically declare our inclusion as false. Labour Party had no representatives in the said meeting and has no association with the Coalition for Nigeria Movement (NIM) in respect to the 2019 general elections. We are not part of any political merger.  “Our party is currently repositioning for the onerous task of presenting Nigeria with a better alternative to the present government that has not satisfied the yearnings of the majority of the people.”
