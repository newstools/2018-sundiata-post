JOHANNESBURG   – Shares in South African construction firm Murray & Roberts (M&R) weakened in early trade on Wednesday, extending losses to the second day after the company’s board rejected a $400 million buyout offer from Germany’s ATON. AT 0730 GMT, shares in M&R fell 2.38 percent to 13.13 rand after they declined more than 6 percent in the previous session. M&R rejected on Tuesday ATON’s buyout offer 15 rand per share as “opportunistic” and poor value for shareholders. But ATON responded by saying it would wait to hear from shareholders as the offer was “not subject to due diligence and its only condition is obtaining 50 percent plus one share.”(Reuters)
