By Samuel Ajayi ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Rwanda, a predominantly Christian country, has ordered the closure of SEVEN HUNDRED churches in Kigali alone. Justus Kangwagye, the Head of Political Parties and Civil Society Department at the Rwanda Governance Board, had this to say about the closures: On rights of others:
“Worshiping should be done in an organised way and meet minimum standards. Exercising your freedom of worship should not encroach on other people’s rights. They have been asked to halt operations until they meet the requirements.” On infrastructure and hygiene standards:
“For instance, if the infrastructure is deemed likely to cause danger to those worshiping, it is obvious that it fails to meet the requirements.” My Take:
None of the churches, according to reports, reverted to the nonsense of government fighting against God or our Lord Jesus Christ as if Jesus told you to be flouting laws in the name of worshipping Him. The churches simply closed shops until they met standards. In NIGERIA, you see a church erecting a 1000-seater auditorium in a place where it won’t only cause traffic problem, but constitute nuisance to residents of that area. In the name of worshiping God, we encroach on the rights of others, we make life miserable for others and above all, we hide behind RELIGIOUS BLACKMAIL to fight against anyone who makes moves to right perceived wrongs. A church will be holding a mid-week service and noise from blaring loudspeakers won’t allow those in the area have peace until the service is over. Nigeria has the highest number of churches in Africa but arguably the most corrupt. That should tell you something about our hypocrisy. A Christian who nearly brought the roof of the church down on Sunday will increase invoice N7m to N70m the following Monday and goes back to same church next Sunday to give testimony about the greatness of God. Hell must be building sulphuric ovens for some Nigerian Christians…
