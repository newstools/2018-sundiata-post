ABUJA (Sundiata Post) If the Boko Haram faction currently holding the Dapchi schoolgirls hostage are gentlemen as Aisha Wakil made us to believe, why didn’t they release them unconditionally? Wakil told us there is no cause for alarm because the leader of the faction holding them is harmless. Why would a harmless militant leader be holding these poor girls, subjecting them to reign of terror? If they meant no harm, why would they kidnap the girls in the first place? If their motives are pure, why are they still keeping them in captivity? For keeping these traumatized innocent girls hostage, it is clear the Boko Haram faction holding them have a sinister agenda. If they are “harmless”, they won’t be keeping these schoolgirls in the hope of using them as a bargaining chip for ransom and the freedom of their fighters in detention. Of what benefit is Aisha Wakil’s influence on Boko Haram leaders if she can’t talk them out of violence against innocent people and kidnapping for ransom? I would be impressed by her influence if she can help humanity to persuade them to stop these atrocities. I don’t praise a woman who advises her country to pay ransom to terrorists and free their fighters in detention in exchange for the freedom of their hostages.
