Indian Wells (U.S.)     –     World number one Roger Federer advanced to the quarter-finals of the BNP Paribas Open with a 7-5 6-4 victory over Jeremy Chardy on Wednesday. The 36-year-old surrendered just three points on serve in the opening set and took control of the second with a cross-court backhand winner which broke Chardy when tied at 4-4. “I like his play. He hits it big, has a big serve, big forehand,” said Federer, a five-time champion at Indian Wells. “The wind picked up. So, you never know what’s going to happen. But I think we played really good tennis for most of the match.” Federer needed just one hour and 22 minutes to move to 15-0 for the year. The last time he began a season 15-0 was 2006 when he would finish the year with 12 titles and three Grand Slams. Federer will next face South Korea’s Chung Hyeon, who defeated Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas 6-1 6-3. It will be a rematch of their Australian Open semi-final in January when Chung had to retire due to blistered feet. Juan del Potro, a runner-up in Indian Wells in 2013, battled a bad back to outlast Leonardo Mayer 3-6 7-6(2) 6-3. “I was surprised by Mayer’s level today,” del Potro said. “I think I was very smart during the tie-break. After that I turned the match around and took control of the points.” Next up for the Argentine is Germany’s Philipp Kohlschreiber, who advanced with a 6-4 7-6(1) win over France’s Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Kevin Anderson beat Spaniard Pablo Busta 4-6 6-3 7-6(6), with the South African recording 16 aces in a victory that took him to a last eight tie against Croatian Borna Coric. Coric had defeated American Taylor Fritz 6-2 6-7(6) 6-4. Sam Querrey, the lone American remaining in the men’s draw, reached the quarters with a 6-3 6-4 win over Feliciano Lopez of Spain.
