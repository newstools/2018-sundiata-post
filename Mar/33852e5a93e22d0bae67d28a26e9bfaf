By Abiodun Esan Ilorin  –   Gov. Abdulfatah Ahmed of Kwara has called on Federal Government to declare state of emergency on drug abuse in the country. He made the call on Tuesday when the National President of Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) Mr Ahmed Yakasai paid him a courtesy visit in Ilorin. He said the country was faced with major challenges such as kidnapping, armed robbery, cultism and insurgency, largely induced by abuse of drugs usually among youths. He added that “drug abuse goes hand in hand with violence. Most crimes in the world have connection with substance abuse. The governor, therefore, called for “the right steps at all levels of governance to curb the menace of drug abuse.” Ahmed also called for tripartite arrangement between government, regulatory authorities and PSN to fight drug abuse. According to him, youths will be properly sensitised through the arrangement, especially on
misuse of over the counter and prescription drugs. The governor said “the rate at which our youths imbibed this habit of drug abuse is getting out of hand; our youths in basic education level, secondary level and tertiary level are all into it. It is
a very serious situation. “All hands must be on deck to see to the end of this menace.” Yakasai said PSN was engaged in fighting fake and counterfeit drugs in the country and ensuring that there was sanity in drug administration in the country. (NAN)
