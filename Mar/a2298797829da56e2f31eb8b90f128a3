By Nicholas Obisike Enugu    –      Rangers International Football Club of Enugu on Sunday beat Enyimba International FC of Aba 1-0 in a 2017/2018 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) Match Day 12 fixture in Enugu. The only goal of the match was scored in the 4th minute by Bright Silas to give the Flying Antelopes the needed confidence. All efforts by the home team to increase the tally proved abortive, as Enyimba fought back after the interval. Speaking after the match, Rangers’ coach Olugbenga Ogunbote said the match lived up to its tag of “Oriental Derby’’ as the two teams gave a account of themselves. He said the lone goal scored was so precious to the team, considering the pressure of derby games. “What matters is that we have the three points. We were not expecting many goals in the match and thank God we took the lead so early,’’ the coach said. Enyimba’s Ikwouwem Udoting thanked God for their having an injury-free game, in spite of losing the game. But he added that there was still hope as the league was still many matches away. “Losing, drawing and winning are all part of football and today we lost to Rangers and tomorrow we will beat other clubs. “This game has come and gone and we have to put it behind us and focus on the forthcoming matches of the league and our continental league matches,’’ the player said.
