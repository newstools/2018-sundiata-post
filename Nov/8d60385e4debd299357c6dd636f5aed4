By Shehu Danjuma Daura     –        The Emir of Daura, Alhaji Farouk Umar, has turbaned Malam Yakubu Gobir as the Wazirin Hausa-the Chief Adviser of the entire Hausa land.
Gobir was turbaned by the emir at a ceremony on Tuesday in Daura town of Katsina state which was attended by individuals from different parts of the country. Umar urged the newly turbaned Waziri to be upright and avoid anything that would tarnish the image of Daura Emirate and the entire Northern Nigeria.
“I have been given the mandate by emirs in the Northern Nigeria to bestore on you the title of Wazirin Hausa.
“Daura Emirate council is the only council that can give a traditional title that covers the entire Northern Nigeria based on its historical background,” he said.
The emir cautioned some historians who are attempting to distort the historical facts of the Daura town especially regarding the emergence of Bayajidda to stop.
“We in Daura are aware that some disgruntled historians are desperately trying to destroy evidences about Daura history.
“We have evidences like the Kusugu well and the sword used to kill the snake inside the well.
“We still have the room of Queen Daurama inside the Emir’s Palace for all doubting Thomases to see,” he said.
NAN reports that Gobir, a native of Kwara state was given the traditional title of Wazirin Hausa based on his philanthropist gesture to people at the grassroots in his state and other parts of Northern Nigeria.
