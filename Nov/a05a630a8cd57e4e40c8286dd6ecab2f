By Abdullahi Shugaba Gumel,    –       Hajiya Balaraba Abdullahi, Social Democratic Party (SDP) Women Leader in Jigawa, has appealed to women to support the party in the state.
Balaraba stated this during the inauguration of the state’s North West Senatorial office in Gumel on Sunday.
She explained that the SDP is the only party that can free women from discrimination, hunger and poverty in the state.
Balarabe lamented that majority of women in the state were living in abject poverty as they were not carried along in other parties.
“If we vote for SDP and it wins election in 2019, many of us will be engaged in profitable entrepreneurship that can keep us afloat.
“This is because time has gone when women will just sit down idle doing nothing and waiting for their husbands to provide everything.
“It is necessary for us to join the SDP which can provide employment for us and our children,” she said.
Also speaking, the SDP governorship candidate in the state, Alhaji Bashir Adamu urged the people to vote for him in the 2019 general election.
Bashir said he is not contesting to make money but to render services for the humanity.
He pledged that if given the mandate, he would provide dividends of democracy to the masses through water supply, hospitals, schools, electricity and other amenities.
“Agriculture will also get a boost during my administration if I am elected as the governor,” Adamu said.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the event was witnessed by party supporters and members from all the eight Local Government Areas (LGAs) in the district.
They include Kazaure, Ringim, Taura, Yankwashi, Roni, Suletankarkar, Gwiwa and Garki.
