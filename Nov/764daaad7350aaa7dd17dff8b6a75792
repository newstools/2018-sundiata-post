By Yemi Adeleye Lagos –   The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will display names of registered voters in Lagos State in all the 8,465 Polling Units in the state between Nov. 6 and Nov. 12. The commission made this known in a statement issued by Mr Femi Akinbiyi, the INEC’s Public Relations Officer in its Lagos State Office, on Friday. According to him, the exercise will hold between 9:00am and 3:30 pm within the appointed days. “The aim of the display is to allow all registered voters check for the correctness of their details and other information supplied to INEC during registration. “Registered voters who have complaints on supplied information are to lodge their complaints with INEC staff at the Registration Area Centres located within their area for appropriate attention. “The Commission will also use the occasion to distribute Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) to those that registered in 2011, 2014 and those that registered during the last Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise between April, 2017 and March, 2018,” Akinbiyi said. He said that the PVC collection during this period would be at the Registration Area Centres (i.e Ward level). “We therefore enjoin all Lagosians that have registered between the above mentioned periods to make use of the opportunity to collect their cards,” Akinbiyi said.
