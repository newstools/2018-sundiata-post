By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja –   The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) says Nigerians wre eager to elect its Presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, as the next president of the country. PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said this while receiving leaders of Coalition of youth groups from Kano, Katsina and Kaduna states, at the party National Secretariat on Wednesday in Abuja. Ologbondiyan said that Nigerians were eager to elect Abubakar because he had demonstrated that the essence of leadership lies in applying its powers and privileges for the good of others rather than self. He said Abubakar was generally accepted as a unifier, a broad-minded leader, who is committed to the welfare and uplifting of living standard of Nigerians. He said that since the popular emergence of Abubakar as PDP Presidential Candidate, the All Progressive Congress (APC) and its candidate’s camp had continued to deplete in millions. “Nigerians have reached a consensus to rally round Abubakar, who embodies a hope of national rebirth, democracy, unity and constitutional order; wealth creation, youth empowerment and that aspiration for a prosperous nation, where all are free.’’ He described Abubakar as a world class entrepreneur, widely accepted as epitome of wealth creation and youth empowerment and whose policy direction provides practical answers to the challenges confronting the nation today. “That is why Nigerians are eager to go to the polls. That is why they want to elect him as their next president,” Ologbondiyan said. Speaking earlier, the coordinator of the coalition, Malam Yusuf Maikano, said they were at Wadata Plaza to register their their support for Abubakar having from the APC ahead of the 2019 general elections.(NAN)
