Vancouver   –      Canada’s British Columbia (B.C.) Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS said it had renewed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with China’s AIDS Control and Prevention Agency. Head of BC centre, Dr Julio Montaner, announced this in Vancouver on Friday. He said that the document was signed between the centre and National Centre for AIDS/STD Control and Prevention, Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. “The centre launched a new three-year HIV Treatment as Prevention Fellowship that would bring three Chinese scientists to Vancouver to work with researchers and clinicians at a centre at St. Paul’s Hospital,’’ Montaner said. He said that his idea was to increase HIV/AIDS detection to 90 per cent globally, expand treatment to 90 per cent of patients and reduce 90 per cent of cases to undetectable levels by 2020. Montaner, however, said that HIV infection rates were increasing in parts of the world and that overall investment in HIV research and treatments had flat-lined in the last 10 years.
