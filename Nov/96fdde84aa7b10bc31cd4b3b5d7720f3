 Tiwa Savage has dropped her latest single “One” for our listening pleasure. The track, sung mostly in Yoruba, is a spiritual ballad that sees the singer expressing gratitude for her success and flexing her honeyed vocals atop light, slowed-down production. Tiwa does have a lot to be thankful for after all, considering she recently became the first woman to win Best African Artist at the MTV Europe Awards and has dropped a number of memorable hits this year, including “Luva Luva” featuring nd most recently “Shake It” with D’Banj. Also appearing in the much talked about video for Wizkid’s “Fever.” She’s had a big 2018, and it’s great to hear the singer take a moment to bask in all her success. “One,” produced by is an anthemic jam, and definitely the type of tack you’ll want to sing along to.
