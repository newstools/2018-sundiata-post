Brussels,   –     Facebook boss, Mark Zuckerberg, on Tuesday apologised to European Union lawmakers for a massive data leak. Zuckerberg gave the apology in his latest attempt to draw a line under a scandal that has rocked the world’s biggest social media network. He agreed to meet leaders of the European Parliament to answer questions about how political consultancy Cambridge Analytica improperly got hold of the personal data of 87 million Facebook users. Included in the data was up to 2.7 million in the EU. He said Facebook had “become clear over the last couple of years that we haven’t done enough to prevent the tools we’ve built from being used for harm as well. “Whether it’s fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing people’s information, we didn’t take a broad enough view of our responsibilities. “That was a mistake and I’m sorry’’. His comments, sitting at a circular table with EU Parliament leaders, dressed in a suit, tie and white shirt, echo an apology last month to United States lawmakers.
