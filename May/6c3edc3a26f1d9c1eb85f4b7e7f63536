ABUJA (Sundiata Post) How can the president of a country say he only read in the newspapers that Boko Haram controls territory in the Northeast? How did Buhari say that with deadpan seriousness without realizing how damaging such a statement is to him whether it is true or not? If it’s true, it clearly indicates that he’s not in charge, that his Generals are lying to him, and that he’s so indifferent about the war that he has not bothered to stay on top of events in the war zone. If his statement is untrue, it is even more discrediting because it means that he’s lying willfully to save face in light of his previous, repeated lie that Boko Haram no longer controls any territory. And, by the way, if not that the original report of Boko Haram controlling territory and taxing and offering protection to people in that 100 mile territorial radius was in a foreign publication, would the president even have bothered to respond to the revelation? This is a stratospheric level of incompetence combined with arrogance and ignorance. Source: Facebook
