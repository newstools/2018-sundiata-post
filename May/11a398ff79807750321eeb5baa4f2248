By Kabir Muhammad Abuja –   The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) on Friday approved payment of over N700 million to 75 staff members of the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA), who were affected by 2004 compulsory retirement. The FCT Permanent Secretary, Chinyeaka Ohaa disclosed this while receiving the retirees on behalf of the FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello at a sign off ceremony on the resolution of 2004 FCDA retirees matter in Abuja. According to him, the entitlements of the 75 beneficiaries will be paid directly into their accounts within two weeks. “The resolution of the matter, which had been a subject of litigation, had been stalled for 14 years running, causing the affected officers all forms of hardship. “However, in keeping with the commitments of the present administration to the rule of law, the matter would be laid to rest, through the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) window. Ohaa further explained that the minister had graciously decided to give succour to the affected staff by applying human face to the issue. “The minister has graciously agreed to bring your challenges to an end, by giving human face to your issue,’’ he said. Earlier, Audu Umar, chairman, 2004 retirees, explained that the sign off ceremony was an indication that the present leadership of the FCT administration was indeed different and poised to address issues bothering on staff welfare. He appealed to the minister to grant long service award to the affected staff in view of their meritorious service to the nation. Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, Hajiya Hassana Ibrahim thanked the minister, the Permanent Secretary and the entire management staff of the FCT administration. “ I thank you all for taking the bold step to ameliorate our plights by approving the payment without further delay,’’ she said.
