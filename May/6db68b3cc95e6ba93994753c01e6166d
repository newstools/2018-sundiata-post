By Victor Adeoti Osogbo –   Mr Bello Bashiru, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun, says the exit of Olagunsoye Oyinlola from the party will not affect its victory in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state. Bashiru, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Osogbo, said “ the party is bigger than any individual.’’ NAN recalls that Oyinlola, a former governor in the state, resigned from the party on May 9. He also resigned his appointment as Chairman of the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). Bashiru, however, said that the exit of Oyinlola would have zero impact on the success of the party in the Sept. 22 election in the state. “The party is bigger than anybody, Oyinlola was not with us when we won the 2010 election. “His impact in the victory of the party in 2014 election when he joined APC few weeks to the election as far as I am concerned, was very minimal. “Ever since his exit from the party, more people have started joining APC in Odo-Otin Local Government where myself and Oyinlola come from. “One thing I am sure of is that the success of the party in the election without him is guaranteed,” Bashiru said. He urged members of the party to unite ahead of the election, saying it must be won by the party.(NAN)
