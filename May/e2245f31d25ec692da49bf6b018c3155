By Omuboye Sukubo Port Harcourt –   The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers says it will conduct its ward, local government and state congresses in line with the party’s guidelines to ensure peaceful and successful outcome. Chief Davies Ikanya, the APC Chairman in Rivers, stated this at a press briefing at the end of the State Executive Committee (SEC) meeting held at the party’s secretariat in Port Harcourt on Wednesday. He said the guidelines had been read to the SEC members to ensure successful congresses. ” People of integrity will be made to conduct the congresses. We expect that both the referee and the players should adhere strictly to the guidelines,” he said. Ikanya said the party’s constitution and guidelines provided for election to take place at the congress or for consensus if there was an agreement. “Nobody should take rumours about writing of list serious because APC’s constitution and guidelines for congresses provided for consensus, and where that fails, election will take place. “All APC members are free to attend the ward congress where they registered and queue behind their choice aspirants if they cannot agree on a consensus,” he said. The APC chairman also said that all stakeholders had agreed to follow the party’s guidelines to ensure credibility of the process. “The party’s constitution and guidelines provide for punishment to whosoever breaches the guideline once a case is established,” he said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the APC National Secretariat had earlier released a timetable for the party’s ward, local government and state congresses as well as national convention. According to the party’s timetable, the ward, local government and state congresses will hold on May 5, May 12 and May 19 respectively while the national convention will hold on June 23. (NAN)
