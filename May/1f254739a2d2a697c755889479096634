By Modupe Adeloye Ibadan –  The wife of the Oyo State governor, Mrs Florence Ajimobi, on Wednesday distributed food items to women in the 352 wards of the state to commemorate the Ramadan. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that items distributed included 450 bags of rice, 1,000 cartons of pasta, beverages as well as other food items. Speaking at the forum at Government House, Agodi, Ibadan, the governor’s wife said that the gesture was to share love with one another. “We all must show love and imbibe the habit of sharing in this period. We must also show love to the less privileged by sharing whatever we have. “I join our Muslim faithful and all other Nigerians in giving thanks to God whose grace and benevolence have helped our nation to overcome the many challenges it has had since we celebrated Ramadan last year. “The annual commemoration of the Ramadan is a most auspicious time for us as individuals and as a nation, to rededicate ourselves and to have a forgiven heart this period. “Let us all, therefore, resolve at this season to make the ideals of peace, harmony, tolerance, love and goodwill to all even more manifest in our interactions with others,’’ she said. The governor’s wife urged the newly elected women councillors to use their positions to assist other people and ensure that the items reached the appropriate quarters. Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, the APC women leader in the state, Mrs Mabel Williams, said that the distribution exercise was a yearly gesture by the wife of the governor. She added that the governor’s wife had relived the hopes of the people through the distribution of food items and cash during festive periods. (NAN)
