Abuja (Sundiata Post)  –  Deputy Governor of Bauchi State,  Nuhu Gidado had on Wednesday tendered his resignation. According to news monitored on Channels TV, he sent his letter to Governor Mohammed Abubakar over waning desire in the job.  Gidado’s resignation  brings to three the number of high-ranking officials that have left Governor Abubakar’s cabinet.  Recall that  in December 2017, Shehu Ningi who is the commissioner for Budget and Planning also resigned his appointment.  His resignation came barely twenty-four hours  after Governor Abubakar presented the 2017 budget estimates to the state’s House of Assembly.  He claimed “the governor did not encourage members of his cabinet to offer advice on how to run the state.” He explained that the environment in which he would have exercised his advisory role as member of the State Executive Council was “unaccommodating, debilitating and non-adviser friendly”.  In March, the Special Adviser to the governor on Investment, Samaila Sanusi, also resigned due to “unfriendly working environment”.  Sanusi claimed all avenues to hold talks with the governor on official issues and development were unsuccessful.  Munnir Yisin, deputy caretaker chairman of Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area, also tendered his resignation around the same period.
