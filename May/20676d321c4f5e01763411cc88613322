Lagos – A Lagos State  lawmaker, Mr Dipo Olorunrinu, has appealed to the Federal Government to protect children’s future more through massive investments in education and healthcare. Olorunrinu, the only PDP lawmaker in the Lagos State House of Assembly, made the call at a Children Day’s party he organised in FESTAC Town, Lagos, on Saturday. The lawmaker, who represents Amuwo Odofin I in the Assembly, said that free quality free education would go a long way to secure the future of Nigerian children. “These are our hope of tomorrow; we must give them priority in all our policies. Child Rights Act must be domesticated by all Houses of Assembly to protect these children. “Neglect of children in our programmes and policies is like shooting ourselves on the foot,’’ he said. He advised children to be focused and diligent and guard against negative peer pressures. Chief Jelili Alebiosu, the Chairman of PDP Amuwo Odofin LGA, hailed Olorunrinu for the gesture, saying that it demonstrated kindness. The Wife of the lawmaker, Mrs Yewande Oloruninu, called on well-meaning Nigerians to give back to the society. She urged parents to do their possible best to take good care of their children. A parent, Mr Joshua Olayande, commended the lawmaker for identifying with children. “By so doing, you started on a good cause,’’ he told the lawmaker. A 13-year-old SSI student who participated at the event, Miss Precious Oikeh, thanked the legislator for the gesture. “It is awesome,” she told NAN. A JS3 student, Master Abdullahi Muhammed, also aged 13, said that the lawmaker made him happier. NAN reports that the annual event was the third by the legislator. (NAN)
