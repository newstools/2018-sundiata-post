Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has told his teammates that he will not be returning to the club after the World Cup, according to a report. Last, year Neymar joined PSG from Barcelona in a world-record €222million (£198million) move but he is now intent on leaving the French club, as reported by AS. The Brazil international scored 28 times in 30 appearances for the French giants since his summer move from Barcelona before sustaining a broken metatarsal in February. However, Neymar has long been rumoured to pine for a move away from PSG at the end of the season, with Real Madrid believed to be frontrunners for his signature. According to the report, the 25-year-old has said his goodbyes to his PSG colleagues as he seeks to play football elsewhere. Last week, a report in AS claimed that Real held ‘secret talks’ with Neymar over a potential return to Spain ahead of the 2018-19 campaign. New Telegraph
