ABUJA    –     A week after the chief of Army staff, Lt General Tukur Buratai gave soldiers stationed in the Birnin-Gwari axis of Kaduna State to flush out armed bandits that have been terrorising and killing people in the area, three housewives have been forcefully abducted in Maganda village in the early hours of Saturday. Disclosing the new development to PRNigeria, a top member of Birnin-Gwari Vanguards for Security and Good Governance who pleaded anonymity said that the armed bandits arrived in the middle of the night to attack the Maganda village. He said: “Last night around 1.30 am, some armed bandits invaded Maganda community and started shooting sporadically. After a while, they invaded the residence of Alhaji Adamu Nakwalla and abducted three wives. They later released one of the wives with a telephone number to contact them “Before the incident, they had sent a warning message to the people in the community that they would come soon. “No life was lost but a young man in the community sustained bullet injury “As at the time of the attack, there was neither security post nor security personnel in Maganda. In fact, we have no single police post in the area.” Meanwhile, Between January and May, many communities in Birnin Gwari local government of Kaduna State have come under attacks by armed bandits. Recent media reports indicate that the attackers appear to pick villages at random, as there appears to be no pointer as to what informs their choice. Both thickly and sparsely populated communities have been attacked, and some were looted, while for some, nothing was taken. Some have had their houses burnt, while some were spared. The casualty rate in all the attacks within less than five months, has equally been alarming, as within this year alone, no less than 162 persons have been shot or stabbed to death including 11 soldiers who were ambushed and killed.
