By Awayi Kuje Karu (Nasarawa State) –  Mr Hashimu Gurku (APC-Karu/Gitata) at the Nasarawa State House of Assembly has called on eligible Nigerians to register and collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) before the 2019 general elections in order to exercise their civic rights.
Gurku made the call on Saturday in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at Karu.
He described the importance of PVCs in any election as the only licence to effect the desired positive change by the electorate.
The assemblyman therefore urged his eligible constituents and other Nigerians to register and collect the cards to exercise their franchise as well as ensure good governance in the country.
“The PVC is your right to vote and to be voted for, and I urge my eligible constituency members and other Nigerians who are yet to register to do so and collect their cards,” according to him.
Gurku assured his constituents of his continued determination to initiate more laws and programmes that have direct bearing on their lives and solicited for their support to enable him succeed.
“I will continue to initiate more people oriented projects that have direct bearing on the lives of my constituents,” he added.
The lawmaker also called on Nigerians, especially youths, to avoid violence and shun negative tendencies capable of tarnishing their image for the overall development of the country.
“We must live in peace and tolerate one another, irrespective of our ethnic, religious and political differences in our interest and in the interest of development.
“Peace is priceless, non-negotiable and is the necessary requirement for development,” Gurku said.
He further appealed to Nigerians to continue to support President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration beyond 2019.
The assemblyman said all leaders needed the support of their people, hence the need for Nigerians to give Buhari and other leaders the needed support and prayers to enable them deliver more dividends of democracy. (NAN)
