By Obinna Unaeze  Minna   –     Abubakar Bello, the Niger State governor, on Sunday in Minna reiterated his government’s determination to complete the N2.4 billion Niger Ultra-modern Stadium in Maikunkele near Minna. Bello said the state government was already discussing a downward review of the contract sum with the Chinese company handling the job. “Government will also look into the welfare package of Niger Tornadoes club with a view of upward review,’’ he added. NAN reports that the stadium contract was awarded in 2013 by the immediate past administration of Babangida Aliyu, a former governor of the state.
