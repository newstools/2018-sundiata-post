By Abujah Racheal   Abuja   –     The Chairman Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Sen. Victor Ndoma-Egba (SAN), has called for a fairer deal for Nigerian workers in order to reduce industrial actions in the country. Ndoma-Egba, who said this in his May Day message signed by his Special Assistant Communication, Mrs Clara Braide, on Tuesday in Abuja, noted that strikes have taken heavy toll on the nation’s economy. He urged Nigerian workers not to lose faith in the ability of the nation under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari to surmount these odds. The NDDC chairman noted that notwithstanding the huge challenges the country and its people are currently facing, it would take the support of everyone working in tandem with the Buhari administration to stabilise the economy having come out of recession. “President Buhari alone cannot turnaround the fortunes of the country. “It requires everyone elected and appointed officials, the legislature and the judiciary, the public and private sectors and all Nigerians working together in faith and commitment to bring about the desired change,” he said. Ndoma-Egba said that President Buhari’s anti-corruption crusade when combined with its efforts in curbing leakages and profligacy would save the much needed resources. According to him, the resources can be channeled toward enriching and improving the economy to enable government reinvest these resources in infrastructure and high employment yielding sectors like ICT and Agriculture. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that May 1 every year is being celebrated as the International Workers Day to celebrate the freedom that workers got since the massacre in 1886 in Chicago.
