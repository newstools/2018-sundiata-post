Lagos  –    The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has hailed the conviction of Joseph Nwobike, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria by a Lagos court for perverting the course of justice. The Chairman of CACOL, Mr Debo Adeniran, said in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Tuesday that the development was a plus for the war against corruption. Analysts have over the years viewed the Nigerian judiciary as irredeemably corrupt and constituting a stumbling block in the effort to eradicate corruption in Nigeria. On April 30, Justice Raliat Adebiyi of the Ikeja High Court sentenced Nwobike to 30 days in prison in a case brought before her by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Adebiyi, while delivering the judgment, said that Nwobike was guilty of 12 out of 18-count charges, bordering on offering gratification to a court official and giving false information to the EFCC to pervert justice. The CACOL chairman noted that the development was unprecedented, in view of the status of the lawyer involved. He commended the judge for her courage, saying the judgment should spur the judiciary to further purge itself of corruption. “We are glad that this is happening under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, who has waged a fierce war on corruption. “The judgment should further spur the judiciary to deal with the long-standing problem of corruption in this arm of government.’’ Adeniran commended the National Judicial Council for its interventions to stamp out corruption in the judiciary, urging the council to do more. He said the fight against corruption was the collective responsibility of everyone, advising Nigerians to get involved in the battle.
