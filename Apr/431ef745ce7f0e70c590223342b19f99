By Moses Kolo Kafanchan (Kaduna)  –   Mr Nicholas Garba, a member of the National Assembly, has decried the incessant attacks on his Aso village in Jema’a Local Government of Kaduna State, urging the security agencies to “do something urgent to end them”. Garba, who represents Jemaa/Sanga federal constituency in the House of Representatives, appealed to the Kaduna State government to pay special attention to the area so as to halt the recurring attacks that had claimed many lives. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the lawmaker spoke on Friday in Aso, shortly after visiting the families of two persons killed by gunmen that waylaid them Thursday night. The duo were returning from a hospital in Kafanchan when they were shot and killed by the gunmen around the uncompleted Aso bridge. Garba particularly urged the Joint Military Task Force operating in Jema’a Local Government Area to deploy more men to protect the rural dwellers against bandits that were terrorising them on daily basis. Describing the Thursday night attack as “unfortunate”, he recalled that it was coming less than a week after a similar attack on Bakin-Kogi, near Kafanchan, where six persons were killed. Garba urged the task force to fish out the culprits, saying that many people had fled the rural areas for fear of such attacks. “Until the state government is able to fish out, expose and punish the perpetrators of these heinous crimes, these criminals will continue on their path of perfidy,” he said. The lawmaker said that the situation was particularly bad because the rural areas host the farming population. “From the report we gathered, the six persons killed in Bakin-Kogi were attacked in their farms. If we don’t take urgent steps to end the attacks, there will be no food in the country,” he said. He prayed God to console the families of the bereaved and advised the rural dwellers to be vigilant and report any suspicious movement to the appropriate authority. (NAN)
