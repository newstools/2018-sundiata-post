ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Resigning because of imminent exposure is like making a virtue of necessity, it has nothing to do with principles. When the former Kano State Account General decided to resign because of alleged “interference” in her job, I praised her in the belief that she was doing something rare among our public servants—giving up your job to protect your principle. To my greatest disappointment, however, the woman is now facing an indictment for N100 million fraud. Where is the principle? After briefly making history as the first female Accountant General, Aisha Mohammed Bello has now blotted her copybook. Having to criticize a woman that you once praised is not comforting, especially after making history. Ana yabon kura ta barke da zawo! Anji Kunya, Allah ka Kare mu. Amin!
