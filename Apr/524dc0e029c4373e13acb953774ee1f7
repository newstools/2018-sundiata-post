C​ould this be love or just BFF’s enjoying a special bond? Those were the question fans of the ongoing reality show asked about Alex and Tobi’s unique relationship. Recently Big Brother Naija housemate, Tobi, lovingly presented a gold bracelet given to him by his father to Alex the current Head of House. Before giving Alex the bracelet, Tobi painstakingly explained how the bracelet became his. He said the gold bracelet was a prized possession gotten from his father. Tobi said he was giving it her totally and stressed that”it doesn’t hold you down in any way.” Fellow housemate, Lolu witnessed the beautiful moment and said he would be surprised if Tobi gives Alex the gold bracelet.
