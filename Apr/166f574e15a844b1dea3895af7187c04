ABUJA (Sundiata Post) The Propaganda and Politics of Rice is the most infantile the Buhari administration has engaged itself.
Reason: imported foreign rice brands are more expensive than locally farmed rice. This fact cannot be denied. 
If the propagated rice revolution is real, importers and smugglers of foreign rice would have closed shop by now. The forces of supply, demand and price are potent factors. 
Why not flood the market with the cheap Nigeria rice instead of crying daily over Benin Republic. Source: Facebook
