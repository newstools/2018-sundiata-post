Mr Emeka Ezeh, EEDC’s Head of Communications, said in a statement in Enugu that the new internet-based bill payment known as “Energy Pay’’ was part of the company’s continuous drive toward the development of innovative solutions. According to him, the option will enhance customers’ experience. Ezeh said that the online payment portal, which had been integrated to

safe and convenient option to pay their electricity bills at no extra
or additional cost. “This payment option is an addition to complement other existing bill
payment channels offered by EEDC, thereby making available to its
customers a wide range of convenient payment options. “The service is designed in both English and Igbo languages, and
