ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Sowore is a 47-year-old self-made Nigerian citizen. Minister Shittu is a product of Nigeria’s prebendal crumbs. He is nothing outside of political appointments. He dismisses a 47-year-old as inconsequential and too young. If you are in your 20s and 30s, dismissing Sowore and the other candidates as inexperienced and too young and refusing to even give them a look-in, I am sorry for you. What do you think Shittu thinks of you? Do you think his case is isolated? No, it’s called group-think. Through him, you just got a window into the soul of the Nigerian elite. Those with “experience”! Source: Facebook
