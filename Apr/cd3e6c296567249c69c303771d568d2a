ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Another fresh mounds of graves for 19 citizens including two Catholic priests murdered in Benue State is underway as I write. They are now part of a wildly mushrooming gruesome statistics of death. Mere statistics â€” soon to be forgotten in a burgeoning file listing bodies murdered in cold blood and which cases have gone stone cold with no suspected killer arrested nor on trial. No emotions. The President says the murders are satanic. After years of wanton and endless mass killings, all Mr Buhari can give is the puerile statement of satanism. Everybody knows that. What people want is safety and justice. You are the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and Executive President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Thus the awesome powers of the army, navy, air force, police, state security, military intelligence agencies, among others are all under your thumb. Yet, for three years since 2015, alleged herdsmen murders have been mounting up thousands of slaughtered defenseless citizens lying still and cold in graves. Yet no arrest. No convictions. Nothing. President Buhari, I have nothing to say to you. Source: Facebook
