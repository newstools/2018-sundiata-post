ABUJA (Sundiata Post) For days, I have been asking myself: is there any country where politics is as lucrative as it is in Nigeria? And as long as politics remains as lucrative as it is here, Nigeria can NEVER progress. This is not a curse! We are yet to critically examine (and understand) the nexus between DECAYING INFRASTRUCTURE, DROPPING LEVEL OF EDUCATION, NON-FUNCTIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM and POLITICIANS BUILDING HOUSES IN BANANA ISLAND, BUYING PRIVATE JETS AND SENDING THEIR KIDS ABROAD. Due to the fact that we are sharply divided along religious and ethnic faultlines, with the attendant brainwashing that only a certain party has thieves in its ranks, politicians use poverty to hold us down and prevent us from asking critical questions. * Why should someone be sharing a congo of rice and half litre cooking oil and a Master degree holder will be posting it on facebook as dividends of democracy? * Why should a senatorial aspirant be spending close to N800m (mostly borrowed) and you actually think he wants to go and serve you? * Have we ever asked why suddenly, a man elected as Reps member or even appointed as SA to the president can afford to buy a duplex in Magodo within a year? * Have we ever asked why political contest, IF TRULY POLITICS IS FOR SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE, is always deadly and violent in this country? Deep inside us, we have accepted that when you go to public office, you MUST make money. Even some of us who criticise them go to them and make some crazy and incredible demands from them. We invite them to social and religious functions. We expect them to make heavy donations. Yet, you know their official salaries. So where will the money come from? A governor, even with his official remuneration, can hardly afford a decent five-bedroom duplex in Lekki. You may do your calculations vis-a-vis prevailing cost of houses in that area. Yet, he will have over five of such houses in choice locations within four years. Yet, same you, begging your friends, both in real life and social media, for N10k family support, will come to facebook and be defending such governor and even worse is that the roads in your home state are the worst in the geo-political zone! CAN YOU NOW SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HIS DUPLEXES AND THE TERRIBLE ROADS IN YOUR STATE? I have never seen a society that gets the kind of leadership it does NOT deserve. Nigeria cannot be an exception! Source: Facebook
