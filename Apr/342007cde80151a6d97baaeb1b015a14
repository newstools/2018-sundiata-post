ABUJA (Sundiata Post) The political war that was waged by Gov.Yayaha Bello of Kogi state in connivance with the APC-led federal government against an outspoken Sen. Dino Melaye came to an inglorious end yesterday in favour of the latter. In spite of all the billions of naira spent and the deployment of government apparatus for the recall nonsense, yet, to no avail. Shame on Gov Bello! Shame on APC!! This is an indicator that moneybag and government-might can no longer ambush and fine-tune public opinion in favour of a non-performing administration. Whosoever has an ear, let him hear that it’s quiet impossible to successfully rig an election and win in a place where one is not popular arrising from non-performance. Therefore,  2019 presidential election would be a “hard crack” for APC!
