ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Nigeria is now the world thearter for amusing movies exceptionally scripted by political dramatists under APC with a defined mandate to make it,  “one week, one drama show.  
The sponsors of today’s edition can easily be predicted by anyone who follows the trend of superiority cold war existing between the  Executive and the Legislative Arms. Senator Agege, an unrepentant exponent of president Buhari’s election order, who got suspended fortnight ago for defiance action was reportedly sneaked in Nicodemusly to the upper legislative chambers with the company of hoodlums to cause mayhem at the plenary. The end story is that, his paid thugs grabbed the mace and escaped out of the chambers untouched. These guys must be magicians to have dribbled and beat  a well structured security architecture in the National Assembly and went away with such a treasonous terrorism. It was hilariously another interesting path seen the security brass after the incident  jumping from pillar to post in a bid to cover up a palpable complicity. Ladies and gentlemen, don’t be deceived, the same “order from above ” that amputated the will powers of the security apparatus to act against the triumphant invasion of Boko Haram at Daptchi, might have played a prominent role at NASS episode today. Sen.Omo Agege only played the role of “scapgoatism” in the saga, the real actors behind the scene are the “Villa boys” saddled with a concealed agenda to demonize the leadership of Sen. Saraki who’s believed to be a thorn in the flesh of APC as soon as 2019 poll is concerned.
I have watched how pandemonium broke out in the National Assembly including the developed  democracies,  where legislators exchange blows but yet to see or hear anyway in the world that hired thugs could invade a supposed hallowed chambers and bullied out a mace except in Nigeria under the APC government.
