Abuja  –   The Chief Iman of the Nigerian Air Force Base Central Mosque, Abuja, Group Capt. Lukman Lawal, has called on Nigerians to pray for peace and progress in the country. Lawal made the call in his sermon at the Juma’at prayer to mark the 2018 Anniversary Celebration of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) which is slated for May 3 to May 6 in Kaduna. The Jumaat prayer is one of the religious activities organised to celebrate the occasion. ” Today, we are commemorating the anniversary of the NAF; it is an annual event, and as we all know, every year we welcome Air Force personnel to commemorate the existence of the NAF. ” We normally celebrate it with prayers for the leadership of this nation and of course the leadership of the NAF and officers and men of the NAF,” he said. He also urged Nigerians to embrace the trust bequeathed to the nation by God. “In essence , we are using this medium to tell everybody in this country that this nation called Nigeria is a trust bequeathed to us by God Almighty, if we make it fine for all of us, if we mar it too bad for all of us. “Hence, we should guard it jealously on what we say and what we do. We don’t have any other nation except this nation of ours. “We should always pray for this nation and the leadership of this nation, that is the message,” Lawal said.(NAN)
