ABUJA (Sundiata Post) ​I think our minds have been conditioned to believe ONLY certain set of people can govern us. And that is why we keep recycling useless leaders and the country remains on the path of  retrogression. 
Have you noticed that any time a young person under 50 says he wants to run for the presidency, the first people to make jest of him or her and dismiss such ambition are those of his age bracket or those younger than him? 
Check the list:
Fela Durotoye Omoyele Sowore Kanu Nwankwo
These are young Nigerians. 
In fact, someone said their ambitions are jokes taken too far. Such lunacy. 
I am NOT pushing for any of these guys but I want us to take our minds back to 1999.
* Niyi Adebayo was 41 when he was elected governor of Ekiti. 
* Saminu Turaki was 36 when he became governor of Jigawa. 
* Orji Uzor Kalu was 39 when he became governor of Abia. 
* Lucky Igbinedion was 42 when he became governor of Edo State. 
* Dimeji Bankole was 38 when he became Speaker of the House of Reps, the nation’s Number Four Seat. 
I can go on. Please what quality does Hassan Dankwambo, the Gombe  State governor,  who is being tipped for the PDP presidential ticket have? That an Omoyele Sowore does not have? For your information, the biggest office Dankwambo held before becoming governor was Accountant-General of the Federation! 
We always revel in how Emmanuel Macron beat all the odds to to become French President at 39 but when someone of his age says he wants to become governor here, same people who clapped for Macron are the people that will dismiss him. 
Something is simply not right with our thinking. Source: Facebook
