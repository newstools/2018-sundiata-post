By Abbas Bamalli  Kano   –     An Islamic Foundation in Fagge Local Government Area of Kano, ‘Abu Ayyub Al-Ansar Islamic Foundation’ on Sunday graduated 121 couples trained on `responsible’ Islamic married life. Speaking at the Graduation ceremony, founder of the Foundation, Dr Umar Sani-Fagge said the training was to inform the couples, especially the men of their responsibilities as the heads of family as provided by Islam. According to him, the rampant divorce in the country, especially the north has become worrisome, therefore, the couples should utilise the knowledge they acquired during the training in reducing the menace. “Such training will also assist the couples to build a better family which can lead to the realisation of a better society. “The Islamic teaching has provided ways and manners in which couples will treat each other in an orderly way in their homes to ensure a peaceful and united family. “Most of the issues responsible for the rampant cases of divorce among the faithful is the lack of Islamic knowledge on the marriage life. “This training is necessary to reduce the issue of divorce which has become a serious challenge to the Muslim society,’’ he said. Sani-Faghe disclosed that out of the 121 couples, 25 would soon tie the knot, while most of them were already married. In his address at the event, the Speaker Kano State House of Assembly, Alhaji Abdullahi Ata commended the founder of the Islamic Foundation for the initiative. According to him, the Assembly will do everything possible to ensure that such course was included in the state primary and secondary school’s syllables `only for study purposes by students.’ “If such course is introduced in the school’s syllable, it will give youths the opportunity to know about the Islamic marriage before getting married,” he said. The speaker also called for continued prayers against the rampant cases of divorce and drug abuse in the society.
