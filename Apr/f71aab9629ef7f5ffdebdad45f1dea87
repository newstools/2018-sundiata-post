By Omuboye Sukubo Port Harcourt –  The Primate of First African Mission Church (FACM), Worldwide, Most Rev. Sunday Matilukuro, on Saturday urged government at all levels to tackle the unbearable poverty in Nigeria. Matilukuro gave the advice at a thanksgiving service in honour of Sen. Andrew Uchendu (APC, Rivers East) at the FACM headquarters in Port Harcourt. “I have travelled round the country and one undeniable fact is that so many Nigerians are poor. “I appreciate the fact that the present Federal Government is committed to the unity of Nigeria but there is hunger in the land. “I have seen people, who do not have homes, and I have seen abject poverty in the North-East; it is more than in any other part of the country,” he said. According to Matilukuro, electorate in Nigeria are getting more informed and “the number that can be bought with peanuts’’ are reducing every day. “Any political leader who wants to be in power must take the issue of poverty reduction very seriously via wealth and job creation. “What I see is more of personal interest than the corporate interest of Nigeria or efforts that will ensure prosperity for the country. “Our leaders don’t know when to stop politicking and the country is gradually turning into Afghanistan; and if that happens, even those in power will not have anywhere to go,’’ the Primate warned. The Primate called on the legislature to partner with the executive to move the nation forward. “So many politicians behave as if there is no God once they get into power; do not lose sight of your humble beginning, no matter your present status,’’ he advised.
