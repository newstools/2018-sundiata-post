By Peter Okolie  Onitsha   –      Archbishop Valerian Okeke of the Catholic Archdiocese of Onitsha on Sunday administered the Sacrament of Confirmation on 14 inmates of Onitsha Prison to mark Year 2018 Easter. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Confirmation is one of the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church. Its administration is to enable the faithful to be filled with the gift of the Holy Spirit to further strengthen them in their Christian life. Okeke in a sermon at the occasion stressed that Easter was the hallmark of Christian faith. He added that the death and resurrection power of Christ was an assurance of hope for Christians. According to him, Christians should reflect on the sufferings and perseverance of Jesus Christ as a realisation that there is no hopeless case with God. He urged the inmates to continue to put their hopes in God and see their incarceration as temporal. “God has a purpose for everything as there is no hopeless case in the sight of God,” he said. NAN reports that 12 male and two female inmates received the sacrament of confirmation. The Archbishop also inaugurated a new church building at the prison quarters and donated welfare materials to the prison inmates to celebrate the Easter.
