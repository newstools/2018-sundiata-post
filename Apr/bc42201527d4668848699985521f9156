 Abuja （Sundiata Post）-   Indigenous People Biafra (IPOB) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari not to run for second term in 2019.  IPOB made the call in a statement signed by its Media and Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful.  According to the statement,  the group’s advocacy trip, Operation Cow Dance, in the United Kingdom, last week, was testimony to its strength.  “In this regard, we have decided to launch Operation Cow Dance 2, to coincide with the planned arrival of the president in Washington, USA, on April 30.  Our leader, Nnamdi Kanu, the prophet of our time had predicted that Buhari will usher in Biafra.  “What happened in London will be a child’s play, compared to what will happen in Washington.  IPOB USA is ready and waiting.”(Sun)
