ABUJA (Sundiata Post) Centuries ago, soon after I departed UNN (argue with your calendar), I received an order from NYSC to report to Benue for national service. I was very angry when I saw the call-up letter. Why “dry” Benue and not some interesting place like hospitable Calabar, funky Lagos, cosmopolitan Enugu or aristocratic Kaduna? I decided not to accept the decision of the anonymous bad belle civil servant who obviously believed that out of all the fun places with job prospects in Nigeria, I was only fit for Benue of all places! I made up my mind to reject the posting. No self respecting Nsukka whazup was going to allow a place like Benue cramp his style. Never! My plan was to report for the orientation programe because I couldn’t avoid that and then, immediately after the four weeks in camp, shake off the Benue dust and abandon the place forever. Then I arrived camp in Katsina Ala and discovered I couldn’t walk away from Benue. Obviously in response to the exodus of unhappy Corpers out of the state, a huge banner with eight words dominated the camp gate. They dripped plaintive, cloying sentiment. I couldn’t take my eyes off them. “WHY CHANGE YOUR POSTING? BENUE IS STILL HOME” It was pure emotional blackmail. And it worked brilliantly on me, a tough guy with a patriotic, akamu heart. The message would have been easy to ignore if it was couched as official and officious order reminding one of the consequences of rejecting posting on frivolous grounds. But this was a message directed, with guiless, unerring accuracy to the heart. I couldn’t ignore the helpless plea and turn my back on Benue. And that was how I ended up spending an unforgettable year in Makurdi, a very hospitable civil service town of simple folks. The memories and some friendships endure. I haven’t been to the place for quite a while but Benue will always remain home. *Source: Facebook
