Laro commended MedShare for contributing significantly to strengthening healthcare in Nigeria. “To address the concerns of my compatriots, I should note that improving healthcare is a major and indeed a strategic goal of the Federal and State Governments in Nigeria. “But having adequate supplies of equipment and medical disposables is crucial to the attainment of this goal. “The important work that MedShare does in this regard, highlights the vital roles that non-profit organisations like MedShare can play when government and other stakeholders engage them in a strategic partnership. “This, as we’ve seen, can become a win-win for all concerned. Going forward, we in the Consulate would like to see many more years of mutually-beneficial cooperation between Nigeria and MedShare. “And we would certainly do all we can to facilitate this. I should not fail to recognise the crucial support that MedShare has received from the corporate world. “Including from the corporate titans such as Coca-Cola and Delta Airlines for the benefit of healthcare in Nigeria. For this, we in the Consulate say a very big ‘thank you’. The Nigerian envoy commended MedShare partnership with key players in the health sector of Nigeria and for organising the Nigeria Day event. According to him, it shows the importance that MedShare attaches to its partnership with Nigeria. “I appreciate the important role that MedShare plays and the depth of the organisation’s partnership with Nigeria.
