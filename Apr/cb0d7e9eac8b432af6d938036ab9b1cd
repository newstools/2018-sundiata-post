By Moses Omorogieva Lagos –  The Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, CP Imohimi Edgal, has ordered that a Superintendent of police, SP Opawoye Adetunji, be given an administrative query for alleged abused of firearm. The Spokesman of the command, SP Chike Oti, disclosed this to newsmen on Monday, stressing that the officer was attached to Sagamu Road Police Station, Ikorodu, as the Divisional Crime Officer(DCO). Oti said that the commissioner was deeply worried over the unprofessional conduct of the officer, adding that the police boss regretted the unwarranted use of firearm where and when not necessary. “The CP has directed that the officer be issued a comprehensive query for shooting a civilian on April 15, 2018 for a yet-to -be determined reason. “The officer who is currently recuperating in an undisclosed hospital alongside his victim, has not been able to give his statement because he is still unconscious as a result of the beating he received and injuries sustained when the mob attacked him at the scene of incident. “The CP further directed that as soon he regains consciousness, he should be served with the query. The command has never and would never tolerate the use of firearm outside the provisions of Force Order 237,” the spokesman said. (NAN)
