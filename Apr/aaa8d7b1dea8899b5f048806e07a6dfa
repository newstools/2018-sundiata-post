By Yetunde Bada Abuja –   The Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Dr Maikanti Baru says the Corporation aims to make Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) the number one in exploration and production. Baru said this in a statement issued in Abuja on Thursday by the NNPC Spokesman, Mr Ndu Ughamadu. According to him, the company is on a growth path and its processes and procedures are fully in line to ensure that it delivers on its mandate set by NNPC. “The NPDC production level was significantly growing and would soon hit the 500,000 barrel per day (b/d) target from its present 230,000 b/d, which would almost place it at par with the highest producers in the country.’’ Ughamadu said the Managing Director of NPDC, Mr Yusuf Matashi, commended the GMD and the NNPC management for their support, which he said had placed the company on the path of steady growth. He disclosed that the company was establishing an LPG plant with a capacity of 330,000 metric tons per day which would upon completion supply about 40 per cent of the country’s LPG demand by producing 1,000 trucks per day. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that NPDC is one of the upstream subsidiaries of the NNPC. It was established in 1988 and it began operations from the Oredo field, and is presently among the top four exploration and production companies as well as the largest supplier of domestic gas to industries in Nigeria.
