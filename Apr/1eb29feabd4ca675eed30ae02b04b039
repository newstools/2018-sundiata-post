A Presidency source disclosed this to our newsmen yesterday.  The source, who pleaded anonymity, said that the trip was to enable the president to attend to some private matters.  The source, however, refused to give the details of those private matters.  The president’s private visit is ahead of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) scheduled to hold in London from April 15 to 20.  When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, declined comment.  Sundiata Post recalls that President Buhari was in London last year, for about three months months to receive treatment for an undisclosed ailment.  His long absence in the country created room for all sorts of rumours about his health condition with groups calling for his return or resume in protests,  especially in the capita city,  Abuja.
