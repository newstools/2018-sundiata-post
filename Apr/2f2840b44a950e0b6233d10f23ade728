London –     Former England captain Ray Wilkins is in a critical condition in a London hospital following a heart attack. “Ray Wilkins is currently being treated at St George’s Hospital, and his condition is critical,” the hospital said on its official twitter feed on Saturday. “His family has asked for privacy at this time, and we are tweeting this update with their agreement.” His wife was quoted as saying he had suffered a cardiac arrest and had to be put in an induced coma. The 61 year-old Wilkins won 84 caps for England between 1976 and 1986. He played more than 150 times for each of Chelsea, Manchester United and Queen’s Park Rangers, with shorter spells abroad for AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. Wilkins has since then been receiving messages of support, with one of them coming from the Nigerian national football team captain, Mikel Obi who is a former Chelsea player. He posted on his official Twitter account (@mikel_john_obi): “Saddened to hear the news about my good friend Ray Wilkins. All my thoughts and prayers are with you for a full recovery. In a 20-year coaching career Wilkins was manager of QPR, Fulham and the Jordan national team, and assistant manager in two spells at Chelsea.
