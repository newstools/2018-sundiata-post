ABUJA (Sundiata Post) You don’t have to like Senator Dino Melaye, but he raised valid questions that are worth our attention. Why should the police insist on taking him to Lokoja for trial, despite the fact that a Federal Court Judge had earlier ordered the case to be transferred to Abuja? If a man fears for his life or safety, and given the fact that the case is infected with dirty politics, why can’t the case be tried in Abuja? Given the special circumstances of this case, I share his concern that his trial in Lokoja is fraught with danger to his life. I haven’t seen a cogent argument yet that justice is better served if he is tried in Lokoja rather than Abuja. Source: Facebook
