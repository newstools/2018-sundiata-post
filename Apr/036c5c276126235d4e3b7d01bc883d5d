By Prudence Arobani  New York   –     The UN Security Council strongly condemned the terrorist attack on Sunday perpetrated by the Al-Shabaab group against the Ugandan contingent of the AU mission in Somalia (AMISOM). “The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” in a statement. The Council underlined the need to bring perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism to justice. The attack reportedly killed and injured a number of soldiers belonging to the AMISOM. The Council underscored its full support to AMISOM in delivering their mandate to reduce the threat posed by the terrorist group Al-Shabaab and armed opposition groups in Somalia. The 15-member Council also paid tribute to all international actors working to bring peace and stability in Somalia. NAN reports that AMISOM is comprised of Uganda, Kenya, Burundi, Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Sierra Leone. AMISOM is an active, regional peacekeeping mission operated by the AU with the approval of the UN in Somalia. It is mandated to support transitional governmental structures, implement a national security plan, train the Somali security forces, and to assist in creating a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian aid. As part of its duties, AMISOM also supports the Federal Government of Somalia’s forces in their battle against Al-Shabaab militants. AMISOM was created by the African Union’s Peace and Security Council on Jan. 19, 2007 with an initial six-month mandate.  The duration of AMISOM’s mandate has been extended in each period that it has been up for review, lastly in October 2014. The maximum allowed strength of AMISOM was 22,126 troops.
