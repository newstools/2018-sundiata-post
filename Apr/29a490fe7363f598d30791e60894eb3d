(Sundiata Post) – The killing of two Catholic priests and some worshippers in Benue State on Tuesday has been described as confirmation that the attacks by Fulani herdsmen across the country are totally designed to wipe out Christian population, destroy their sacred places of worship and institute radical Islamic caliphate. This is the declaration of the International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law (Intersociety). The group made the declaration in a statement issued on Wednesday by its board chairman, Emeka Umeagbalasi and its head of Civil Liberties and Rule of Law, Obianuju Joy Igboeli. The society further alleged that the killings “are carefully designed and systematically executed in two phases and aimed at wiping out members of the Nigerian Christian faith and other non-Muslims particularly in the Northeast, North-central and Northwest with estimated 30 million Christians.” The group also claimed that the first phase of the killings was taking a toll on Christians in Northern Nigeria while the second phase was already closing in on the Southeast and South-south with about 98% Christian and other non-Muslim population. The rights group further claimed that the plot was also designed to take over the Southwest where roughly half of the population are of the Christian faith and other non-Muslims. It said: “Contrary to Federal Government and its sponsored media false claims that the killings, exclusively directed at carefully mapped and identified Christian populations and their sacred places of worship in Northern Nigeria, are as a result of ‘Fulani herdsmen -Farmers clashes over grazing rights and permissions’, the latest disruption of early morning Mass service and massacre of 19 innocent and defenseless worshippers including two Rev. Fathers – Joseph Gor and Felix Tyolaha, two catechists and 15 lay members as well as similar killings across the country since mid 2015 have further exposed the government’s litany of lies against Nigerians and members of the int’l community.” Intersociety recalled that the marauding Fulani herdsmen recognised in Nigerian laws as Miyatti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has President Muhammadu Buhari as their grand national patron.
