ABUJA (Sundiata Post) It is not the lists being released by Lai Mohammed and APC that are the issues here, but the fact that some educated illiterates will take them serious. I had conversation with a Buhari die-hard over the weekend and he did admit that anti-corruption war has been terribly lopsided but his argument was based on the fact that, as they say in Yoruba, a knife cannot carve its own handle. In other words, Buhari cannot arrest not try those who helped him to power. “Egbon, you know he tried three times and failed until he aligned with these so-called bad politicians before he could make it. Let Buhari do this may be coming governments will deal with other ones,” he told me. 
By other ones, he meant those who bankrolled Buhari’s election or stealing right now. 
Now, if Buhari had to jettison his so called “integrity” by aligning with politicians he once saw as thieves to win election and they also BANKROLLED HIS CAMPAIGN WITH STOLEN MONEY, IT MEANS HE WANTED POWER, NOT TO SERVE, BUT TO FULFILL A BURNING AMBITION! 
On this platform, I challenged Ekweremadu on owning 39 houses. So don’t say I am defending looters. But in Nigeria today, NO POLITICIAN WHO HAS HELD PUBLIC OFFICE CAN ACCUSE OTHERS OF BEING A LOOTER. THEY ARE ALL LOOTERS. 
And these include Lai Mohammed himself. 
* It is only in Nigeria that Tinubu will talk of someone stealing public money and you will clap for him. 
* It is only in Nigeria that a Buhari will he accusing PDP of stealing money for election but won’t tell Nigerians how, as a poor man, he ran a campaign of hundreds of billions of naira! 
* It is only on Nigeria that Obanikoro, Orji Uzor Kalu, Audu Ogbe, Chris Ngige, Bukola Saraki, Rotimi Amaechi, Tunde Fashola, Bola Tinubu, Nyako and co will be leading a party accusing others of looting the treasury. You should ask them if it is their fathers’ money they too have been spending. 
Now, if you have sense, ask Lai Mohammed and APC how come politicians from both parties send their kids abroad, organise lavish weddings for their kids, have choice properties in choice locations, have private jets and yet, it is ONLY THOSE IN PDP THAT STEAL?
How do APC politicians make their own money? 
That will tell you that Buhari is the biggest MORAL FRAUD this nation has ever seen and Lai Mohammed the most shameless! Source: Facebook
