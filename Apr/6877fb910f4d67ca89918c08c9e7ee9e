JOHANNESBURG   –   South Africa’s rand weakened early on Monday as a firming dollar and rising U.S. bond yields lured investors offshore and there was little locally to firm the currency. At 0630 GMT the rand was 0.21 percent weaker a 12.1175 per dollar compared to a close of 12.0925 on Friday in New York. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major peers edged up 0.1 percent to 90.401, while U.S. 10-year Treasury yield touched its highest the highest since January 2014 in Asian trade. Despite the losses the rand looks set to carve out gains this week with long term bets still based on global synchronized growth, a positive scenario for emerging market currencies. “Market positioning, as reflected by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission indicates a high conviction in the current ‘narrative’ – i.e. that global synchronized growth will continue,” said Nedbank analysts Mehul Daya and Walter de Wet in a note. * The analysts also said implied volatility across most of the maturity buckets had fallen, reflecting lower domestic risks. Bonds were also weaker, with the yield don the benchmark paper due in 2026 adding 8.085 percent. The stock market was set to open flat at 0700 GMT, with the Top40 futures index down only 0.04 percent.(Reuters)
