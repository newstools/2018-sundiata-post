By Itohan Abara-Laserian Lagos –   The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) on Tuesday called on agriculture policy makers in Africa to consider cassava as a cash crop. Mr Claude Fauguet, Director of the Global Cassava Partnership (GCP21) of IITA, made the call in Lagos at a news conference to announce the 4th International Cassava Conference scheduled to hold in June, tagged: “Transforming Cassava in Africa”. Fauguet told newsmen that cassava was a resilient crop that could survive under any climate, hence, it needed science and technology to grow and develop it. “Policy makers in Africa really need to begin to see cassava as a cash crop and not a poor man’s crop. IITA in the last 50 years has been promoting that school of thought and we are not relenting. “With the current trend of climate change and environmental degradation, cassava comes as one crop that can survive under any weather. “Cassava is resilient to climate changes and can adapt to the changes in the environment unlike other crops that cannot respond to changes in climate,” he said. On why Nigeria is the focus of the media briefing, Fauguet said that the country was a model that the rest of Africa looked up to. Prof. Malachy Akoroda, Director Designate of GCP21, said that IITA was set to partner with stakeholders globally to improve cassava production. Akoroda said that partnerships and reviewing successes of other countries would ensure cassava sustainability and development. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the international conference would be held in Cotonou, Benin Republic from June 11 to June 15, focusing on technology, access to finance and market. (NAN)
