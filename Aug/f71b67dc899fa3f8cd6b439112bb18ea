By Kate Obande-Okewu  Abuja   –       The National Union of Lottery Agents and Employees (NULAE), has called on the National Lottery Trust Fund (NLTF) to use the proceeds from lottery business for the benefit of Nigerians. Mr David Omaghomi, the National Trustee of the Union, made this call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja. Omaghomi said that there was an urgent need for the relevant authorities to call the NLTF managers to order, so that it could live up to its mandate. “By law, lottery operators remit 20 per cent of their gross earnings to the trust fund and the fund is set up to use the earnings for projects as road construction, sports development, health among others. “We are not pointing fingers at anybody, but the lottery industry is dying and not growing at the required speed because it has a poor image. “So the responsibility lies on the trust fund to give the lottery industry a better image by utilising lottery funds in its custody properly. “They should do more public projects that people can benefit from, thereby there will be a paradigm shift in the minds of the people on the relevance of lottery. The union leader noted that the trust fund was the engine room that would propel the growth of the industry; hence it should live up to expectations. He also called on the National Lottery Regulatory Commission (NLRC) to help raise the standard of the industry and sensitise the public on the essence of lottery. “Lottery is not dirty but a game of chance that distributes wealth and a lottery playing nation is a happy nation,’’ Omaghomi added.
