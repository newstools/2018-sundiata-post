BY Rita Iliya  Minna,   –     The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) in Niger says its 2018 Batch B stream II members will take their orientation in Kaduna State. It said that this was based on directives to hold the orientation in cluster in 19 States due to the limited number of corps members in the batch across the country. This was contained in a statement by Mrs Theresa Arokoyo, the NYSC Coordinator in Niger and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Minna. “The corps members are to take their orientation course at the NYSC Kaduna (Black Gold) orientation camp, one of the venues of the cluster camping exercise nationwide,” she said. Arokoyo said that the corps members after the three weeks orientation course would return to the state for posting to their primary places of assignment. NAN reports that only 600 corps members were deployed to the state in the batch.
