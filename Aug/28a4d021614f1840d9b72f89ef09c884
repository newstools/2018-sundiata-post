By Stanley Nwanosike  Enugu –   Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has appealed to the Federal Government to recruit more police personnel to combat security challenges in the country. Ugwuanyi made the call when members of the Police Service Commission (PSC) paid him a courtesy visit at the Government House, Enugu, on Monday. He pledged the support of the State Government toward achieving recruitment plans of the police especially as it concerned Enugu State. “I commend President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing men of integrity, purpose and commitment into the new Police Service Commission. “I wish to congratulate you for your deserved appointment as well as the former Inspector-General of Police, Mr Musiliu Smith, for his appointment as the Chairman of the Commission. “I am delighted that you choose to visit Enugu State first among other states in the country as well as your acknowledgement of our modest contribution to the welfare and repositioning of the Nigeria Police Force,’’ he said. The Chairman of the PSC, Mr Musiliu Smith, thanked Ugwuanyi for his various support to the police command in the state, formations and Police College, Oji River. Smith, who was represented by a commissioner on the commission, Mr Austin Braimoh, said that the commission was highly appreciative as the governor had made security one of the cardinal programmes of his administration. The chairman also thanked the governor for his promise to make available a zonal office for the commission to easily handle cases and complaints concerning the police. “We are assuring you that the commission would work hard to improve the lot of the Nigeria Police and its personnel,’’ he assured.
