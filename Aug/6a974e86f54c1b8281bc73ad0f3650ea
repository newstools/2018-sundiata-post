By Edith Nwapi  Abuja  –    A Wuse Zone 2 Senior Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, on Monday issued a bench warrant on two men for failure to appear in court to stand for their trial. The two defendants, Alkasim Yusuf and Useni Adamu, were charged with criminal intimidation. The Magistrate, Olubunmi Achegbulu, gave the order following the prayer of the prosecutor, Mr Kufreabasi Ebong. The prosecutor had urged the court to issue bench warrant as the defendants were not in court. ” In line with Section 184 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, a bench warrant is hereby issued on the defendants for non-appearance in court. ” Notice is also to be issued on the sureties to come and show cause why the bail bond would not be forfeited,” she ordered. Achegbulu adjourned the case until Aug. 10 for hearing. Ebong had on July 27, told the court that on July 4, one Mustapha Yusuf of Mabushi reported the matter at Mabushi Police Station. Ebong said on the same day at about 8. 30 a. m. the defendants used an unknown phone number to send a text message to the nominal complainant wife’s phone line. He said that in the message, the defendants demanded for N500, 000 or the nominal complainant’s family would be murdered. Ebong informed the court that this offence contravened Section 398 of the Penal Code. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the allegations levelled against them.
