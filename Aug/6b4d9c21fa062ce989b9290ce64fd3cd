By Chinyere Joel-Nwokeoma  Lagos   –     Low, medium and high capitalised equities dominated worst performing table on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) for the month of July in percentage terms.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Tantalizers emerged the worst performing equity in percentage terms with 41.67 per cent.
NAN reports that data obtained from NSE indicated that the stock during the period under review lost 41.67 per cent to close at 21k per share against 36k achieved in June.
Lafarge Africa and Union Diagnostic trailed with a loss of 32.84 per cent and 31.58 per cent to close at N27.50 and 26k compared with the opening price of N40.95 and 38k per share, respectively. Other top losers’ were Dunlop, PZ industries, Capital Oil, Wapic Insurance, Forte Oil, Honeywell and Presco.
Mr Ambrose Omordion, the Chief Operating Officer, InvestData Ltd. , said sell-off across board contributed to losses posted during the period as local investors moved to secure their capital.
Omordion said the development was purely due to the uncertainties surrounding 2019 elections.
He, however, attributed Tantalizer’s emergence as worst performing stock to non-payment of dividend and the new pricing rule of the exchange.
Conversely, Cutix emerged the best performing stock in percentage terms, appreciating by 46 per cent to close at N4.38 per share against N3 achieved in June.
