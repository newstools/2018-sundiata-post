Abubakar, in a message to mark the Eid-el-Kabir celebration issued by his media office on Monday in Abuja, said that religion should be used as a means to advance love among the people. He explained that diversity was not the cause of Nigeria’s problems but the attitude of citizens toward one another. “The common interests that unite Nigerians are by far stronger than those petty factors that divide us,” Abubakar said, adding that diversity could be used to advantage. He said that intolerance, extremism and bigotry, if unchecked, could threaten peace and unity in any country while peace and unity are the greatest assets that should not be taken for granted by Nigerians.

He said that societies founded on hate and bigotry were always exposed to conflicts, adding these negative emotions should only be defeated by the power of love.
