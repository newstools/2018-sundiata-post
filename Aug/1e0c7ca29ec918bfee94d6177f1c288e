By Ugochi Ugochukwu  Abuja   –     The Police on Monday arraigned a man, Wasiu Aweda, at an FCT Grade 1 Area Court, Kado, Abuja, on two-count charge of criminal breach of trust and cheating. Aweda resides at No. 9, Mobsa Street, Gwagwalada, Abuja. The Prosecutor, Judith Obatomi, told the court that one Idowu Olatunyi of opposite Peace Park Utako, Abuja, reported the matter at the Utako Police Station on Aug. 7. Obatomi told the court that Aweda and one other, now at large, loaded the complainant’s truck with goods from Abuja to Lagos. She said that when Aweda got to Ondo State, he criminally called the complainant and told him that the truck had a mechanical problem. She said that Aweda told the complainant to send N36,000 to enable him to repair the truck which he sent to him. The prosecutor said the defendant intentionally converted the money to his personal use and abandoned the truck. She also said the complainant claimed that Aweda sold the truck jerk, spare tyre rim, battery and his laptop which he left inside the truck. She said the offences contravened provisions of Sections 312 and 322 of the Penal Code. Aweda, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Judge, Alhaji Ahmed Ado, granted the defendant N30,000 bail with a reliable surety in the like sum. Ado said the surety must reside within the court’s jurisdiction. He also said that the surety should submit two recent passport photographs and a reasonable means of identification to the court. He adjourned the case until Sept. 25 for trial.
