By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, August 14, 2018, extended his 10-day vacation and has written to the National Assembly to that effect.  The letter signed by the special adviser to the president on media and publicity, Femi Adesina, made available to journalist by Buhari’s personal assistant on media engagement, Bashir Ahmad, stated that the extension was necessitated in order for the president to complete and receive the results of a series of tests recommended by his doctors.  “The President had planned to return to Abuja this evening (Sunday), but was advised to complete the test cycle before returning,” the letter said in part.  “The notice has since been dispatched to the Senate President, and Speaker, House of Representatives. Mr President expresses his sincere gratitude to Nigerians for their concern, prayers and kind wishes.”  The letter did not indicate when the president is returning to the country.  Sundiata Post recalls that approximately a year ago, precisely on the 19th of August 2017, President Muhammadu Buhari returned to Nigeria  after spending three months in London seeking medical treatment.  Buhari has been battling an unspecified illness since the beginning of 2017 and had spent long periods in London receiving treatment.  He first traveled to Britain for treatment from January to march, 2017 and then left Nigeria again on May 7 same year.  His long absence prompted intense speculation in Nigeria about the state of health of the president with many false reports circulating online saying he had died.  The death rumour triggered pro-Buhari and anti-Buhari protests in the country with a group under the auspices of #OurMumuDonDo occupying the Unity Fountain Abuja demanding for the immediate resumption or resignation of the President.
