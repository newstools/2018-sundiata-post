By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja {Sundiata Post} –  British High Commission has reacted to Tuesday’s development at the National Assembly, saying it would only accept a democratic process that recognises the rights of Nigerians to participate in election process.  The commission said this in reaction to Tuesday’s blockade of the National Assembly by masked men of the Department of State Services {DSS} which refused entry to the the lawmakers and the legislative workers who are not politicians.  According to the British Commission, “We are aware of media reports of a situation at the National Assembly this morning. We are closely monitoring the situation and other political developments in Nigeria.  “The United Kingdom supports a process whereby the people of Nigeria can exercise their democratic right to vote and be voted for.”  “We favour a free, fair, credible and peaceful process and the independence of institutions, which allow for that,”  Joe Abuku, a spokesperson for the UK Embassy in Abuja, said in a statement to Tuesday afternoon.  The statement comes hours after Ben Murray-Bruce, a senator from Bayelsa State, asked that foreign sanctions be meted on those involved in the siege at the parliament.  Recall that the Acting President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo has relieved the DG, DSS, Lawal Daura of his appointment and further assured that all security officials who are linked to the illegality that took place at the National Assembly will be sanctioned as the presidency has no knowledge of the incident.
