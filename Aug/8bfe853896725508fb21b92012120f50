By Bridget Ikyado  Makurdi –  Mr Emmanuel Chile, the General Manager of Benue State Environmental Sanitation Authority (BENSESA), said the agency inaugurated ‘operation show your dustbin’ to curb the indiscriminate dumping of refuse in Makurdi. Chile, in an Interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), on Saturday in Makurdi, said the exercise would be extended to other towns in the state. He promised to ensure compliance with the state government’s directive that all streets in cities should have covered bins for the storage and evacuation of refuse. Chile emphasised the need for residents to use waste bins to contain epidemic, prevent blockage of drains and canals, avoid flooding or any form of environmental hazard and beautify the environment. He advised those having difficulty in managing their wastes to call BENSESA for help. The General manager also said over 50 people were arrested for various offenses including absence of standard dustbin, dirty drains, bushy surrounding, filthy environment and lack of dustbins. “We intend to monitor and carry out evaluation frequently, not only during sanitation days until we have a change of attitude towards sanitation in Benue,” he said.
