By Chibuike Nwabuko  Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki, has condemned the last minute cancellation of the approval granted to Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, to utilize the Eagle Square for his 2019 presidential declaration.  In a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Abuja, Saraki stated that the “Eagle Square belongs to all Nigerians” and the cancellation sends a wrong message about the tolerance level in our politics.  “The refusal to allow Senator Kwankwaso to utilize the Eagle Square for his Presidential declaration, despite an earlier approval, sends a wrong message about our democracy, particularly the tolerance level in our politics.  “That square belongs to all Nigerians because it was built with public funds. We hope this is not what we will be seeing as we approach the 2019 General Elections,” the Senate President warned.  Recall that Senator Kwankwaso got clearance to declared his presidential ambition at Eagle Square today but the permission was later cancelled and  was shifted to Chida Hotel In Utoko.
