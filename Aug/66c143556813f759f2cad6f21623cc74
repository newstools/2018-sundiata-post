By Kemi Ajayi  Asaba  –   Nigeria’s Joy Udo-Gabriel says she is not under any pressure as she qualified for the finals of the Women 100m at the ongoing Africa Senior Athletics Championships in Asaba. Udo-GabrIel told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday at the event that she was delighted to be in the finals of the event scheduled
for later in the day. The athlete, who was part of Nigeria’s Women 4x100m bronze winning team at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia,
said she was excited to represent her country in the ongoing event. “I am happy to be in the finals of the 100m here in Asaba, I am not under any pressure, I am also very excited to run at home,” she said. The 18-year-old athlete said that Ivorian Marie-Josee Talou was the only threat to her, adding that running with her would help her to
