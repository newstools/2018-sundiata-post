By Joy Kaka  Abuja   –     A Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Thursday granted one Hajia Yusuf Hadiza custody of her three children‎. The judge, Abdulwahab Mohammed granted ‎Hadiza custody of her three children aged 13, 12 and 11, following her petition for custody against her ex-husband, Usman Umar. ‎Mohammed who relied on `Tuhfatul-Hukam,’ ‎which contains principles of Islamic law, said custody was granted Hadiza because the children are minors. He said that visiting of the children should be agreed between Hadiza and Umar. Hadiza had sought custody of her three children whom she said Umar took away from her in 2012 when they were 7, 6 and 5 ‎years old respectively. She alleged that her children were not taken care of and prayed the court to grant her custody of all her children. Umar in his response, said he took good care of the children, adding that they ran away from their mother occasionally and he would be called from Sokoto State ‎to be informed of the development. Hadiza and Umar got married in Kano State in June 2004‎, the marriage produced four children, while they divorced in 2013.
