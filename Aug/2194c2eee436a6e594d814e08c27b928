Tafida-Abdul said the survey, being run in partnership with Federal Ministry of Health, would gather data on fertility level and preferences; contraceptive use, maternal and child health, infant and neonatal mortality level and violence against women. Other areas of focus include, immunization, nutrition, breastfeeding, awareness on HIV/AIDS as well as other indicators relevant for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Tafida-Abdul maintained that the survey would also foster and reinforce Nigeria’s ownership of data collection, analysis, presentation and use by utilizing its own manpower. The coordinator said adequate logistics arrangement have been made for the smooth conduct of the exercise in the state. He therefore solicited the assistance of the state and local government, security agencies, traditional institutions and other stakeholders to enable field workers unfettered access to the selected clusters.
