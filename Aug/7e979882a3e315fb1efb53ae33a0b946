By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  The All Progressives Congress (has) described as hogwash and baseless accusation by the People’s Democratic party (PDP) that the federal government is planning to arrest the Senate President, Bukola Saraki and his Deputy, Senator Ike Ekweremadu. The party which said it thought that by now, the PDP would be tired of its lame opposition strategy of false alarms and frivolous accusations, disclosed this on Monday in a statement signed by the Acting National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yekini Nabena. The statement reads in full: The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in its latest round of bogus claims has alleged that the Federal Government plans to arrest the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki and his Deputy, Senator Ike Ekweremadu. We had thought that by now, the PDP would be tired of its lame opposition strategy of false alarms, baseless and frivolous accusations. The President Muhammadu Buhari administration has repeatedly demonstrated its strict adherence to the rule of law, therefore the alleged plan to arrest or harass the mentioned leaders is hogwash and baseless. Clear conscience fears no accusation. Why are PDP leaders afraid of arrest if their conscience is clear? All law-abiding citizens or resident of the country have nothing to fear about arrest. However, nobody no matter how highly placed will escape the full wrath of the law if he or she runs fowl of our laws. If the Senate President and the tree-climbing Senator are facing criminal charges in our law courts and his Deputy has explanations to make to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for acquisition of numerous properties in Nigeria and abroad through questionable sources, the President Buhari-led APC administration has nothing to do with them. The laws of the country are only being applied and they should answer for their acts of infamy.  SIGNED: Mr. Yekini Nabena Ag. National Publicity Secretary All Progressives Congress (APC)
