By Wandoo Sombo  Abuja   –     Members of the Nigerian Bar Association(NBA), will go to the polls on Monday midnight to elect new executives amid fears that the elections may be marred in irregularities. NBA President, Mr Abubakar Mahmoud (SAN), had given the assurance that the election would be free, fair and devoid of irregularities. He further disclosed that about 32,000 lawyers were eligible to take part in the election, which will usher in a new leadership that will pilot the affairs of the association in the next two years. Voters were to scale the verification exercise that ended by midnight of Sunday, Aug. 5 in order to participate in the elections. The list of eligible voters, according to Mahmoud, was collated from the 125 branches of NBA in Nigeria and the Supreme Court. Mahmoud had previously explained that the NBA election earlier scheduled for July 27 and 28 could not hold as scheduled due to issues raised in some quarters surrounding the credibility of the verification process. The voting which is expected to start midnight of Aug. 6 will be via electronic platform and will last for 48 hours.
