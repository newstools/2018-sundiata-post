The accused is facing trial on a two-count charge for obtaining under false pretences and stealing. He, however, pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Insp. Oladela Adebayo, told the court that the accused committed the offences sometime in 2011 at a market in Ebute Meta. Adebayo submitted that the accused collected a half bag of melon worth N50,000 from one Mrs Onome Igwe, with a promise to pay for the goods after sales. “After he was given the N50,000 worth of melon, the accused absconded.

The Chief Magistrate, Mr O.O. Olatunji admitted the accused to bail in the sum of N50,000 with two sureties in like sum. He fixed further hearing in the case for Sept. 24.  (NAN)
