By Yashim Katurak  Abuja –  The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), has declared Aug. 30 a national day of protest against what it described as “impunity against the Nigerian journalist.” Shuaibu Leman, the NUJ National Secretary, in a statement on Monday in Abuja, directed all the State and FCT Councils of the union to mobilise the members for the protest. Leman directed the councils to stage protest within their respective press centers. He said that protest could also be organised in selected media organisations, urging the state councils to also ensure full media coverage of the event. “We appeal that you all make adequate mobilisation to ensure that members attend and participate fully. “Speeches should be made by stakeholders and where applicable, mention instances of such attacks and breeches.” The secretary said the councils should intimate the State Governments of the planned protest, pointing out that the union’s national secretariat had sent a letter to Presidency regarding the plan.
