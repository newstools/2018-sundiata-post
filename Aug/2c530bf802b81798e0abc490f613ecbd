By Zubairu Idris Katsina –   Gov. Aminu Masari of Katsina State has urged communities in the state to expose criminals dislodged by the ongoing military operations in neighbouring Zamfara State. Masari made the call on Wednesday when the Emir of Katsina, Alhaji Abdulmumini Kabir, paid him the traditional Sallah Homage. “You know the army and the Nigerian Air Force have launched an operation against bandits in Zamfara State. “Some of the bandits have started relocating to communities around Rugu Forest in Katsina State. “They are the rustlers and kidnappers terrorizing people in the society. “Expose them and their hideouts because they are of no importance other than causing trouble.” The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari had in July approved the establishment of Operation Whirl Stroke II in Zamfara, Kaduna states following the continued killing of innocent citizens by armed bandits. The governor also urged people who had not registered in the ongoing Voter Registration to do so. “You should ensure that you register, obtain your PVC and come and vote during the 2019 general elections.” He also advised the people not to allow their children to be used by politicians to cause trouble during the 2019 general elections. Earlier, the emir urged the people to imbibe the habit of environmental cleanliness in order to reduce disease outbreak in the state. Kabir also expressed dissatisfaction over the high incidence of drug abuse among youths and women. He, therefore, urged all stakeholders to intensify efforts at checking the menace.
