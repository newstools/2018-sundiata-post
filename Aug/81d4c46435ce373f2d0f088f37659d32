By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja {Sundiata Post} – Former minister of Aviation and a Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, {PD} Chief  Femi Fani-Kayode has asked the Party not to focus its attention on the dead All Progressives Congress {APC} but rather think of who will be a perfect presidential candidate for the resurrected PDP in the forth coming general election in 2019.  Fani-Kayode who informed that the main issue confronting the PDP now is  who can win, who can do a good job and who can heal the terrible divisions in our nation, disclosed this when he took to his twitter handle @realffk. Fani-kayode on his Twitter handle said： ‘Let the dead bury the dead: our focus should no longer be on the dead APC but on the resurrected PDP. The most important decision for us to make today is WHO our presidential candidate will be? Who can win, who can do a good job and who can heal the terrible divisions in our nation. Game on.  Recall that APC last week witnessed mass defection of his key members to the opposition PDP.  The members who left the party last week are：the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki, Governor of Kwara State, Abdulfatta Ahmed, members of Kwara House of Assemby, Governor Aminu Tambuwal as well as Governor Samuel Ortom  to mention but a few.
