By Oluwabukola Akanni Ibadan –  Dr Khadija Alarapa, the Head of Health Promotion and Nutrition, Oyo State Primary Healthcare Board, on Thursday disclosed that five out of 10 infants are exclusively breastfed in the state. Alarape made this known at the on-going weeklong workshop organised by the state government to mark the 2018 World Breastfeeding Week in Ibadan. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports Aug. 1 to Aug. 7 is celebrated as World Breastfeeding Week annually. Alarape said that breastfeeding the infant for the initial six months of birth is extremely important for the baby’s health. “Presently, the prevalence rate of breastfeeding in Oyo State, according to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) survey 2017, indicates an increase from 30.4 per cent in 2013 to 49.5 per cent. “This shows that almost half of our babies are being exclusively breastfed. “This is a good and encouraging figure; the government has been implementing policies to promote and encourage exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life,’ she said. According to her, exclusive breastfeeding provides a solid foundation for the child. “Building a solid foundation for the child through exclusive breastfeeding in the first 1,000 days of life ensures that the child is well established and can contribute meaningfully to the society in future,’’ she said. Earlier, the Executive Secretary, Oyo State Primary Healthcare Board, Dr Waheed Abass, urged nursing mothers in the state to see exclusive breastfeeding of their infants as very essential. He said that the practice would lead to the physical and mental development of the infants. Also speaking, the Chief Consultant of Adeoyo Maternity Hospital, Dr Adeyanju Olusoji, said that exclusive breastfeeding promotes proper growth of the child. He added that this would also reduce the risk of nutritional deficiencies at a later stage in the life of the infants.  (NAN)
