By Bridget Ikyado  Makurd   –    Veteran Basketball Star John Allagh has urged governments and community groups to re-double efforts in harnessing the potential of youths in sporting activities. He gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) after making donations of sporting kits to the Benue Braves Basketball team at the Aper Aku Stadium in Makurdi on Wednesday. He also called on wealthy individuals, corporate organisations to actively invest in sports to complement efforts at empowering the youth. The Benue-born former Nigeria basketball international player also said that all categories of sports should be developed in the grassroots, primary, secondary and tertiary institutions. He expressed optimism that through proper organisation of sporting activities, talented individuals with good potential could be spotted. Describing sports as window of opportunities which enhances social and economic lives, he said “I am urging government at all levels to redouble commitments in supporting youths sporting activities. “All forms of sports should be encouraged and supported not only in football but also in other sports to ensure effective shaping of people’s character, especially youths for them to shun drug abuse and other forms of vices.’’ He also called on parents to allow their children to engage in sports, noting that it would not hinder their educational pursuits. He allayed the fear that engaging youths in sporting activities would deprive them of involving in other productive businesses. Receiving the kits on behalf of the State Basketball Team, Mrs Maltina Onma- Emmanuel, the Head Coach of Benue Basketball, appreciated Allagh for the gesture. She promised that the kits would be put to proper use, observing that that the team also needed other support in sports
