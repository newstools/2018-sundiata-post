By Gami Tadanyigbe Gwagwalada (FCT) –  El-Mond Global Initiative, (MGI), a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), on Monday, organised free medical outreach for residents of Pasu community in Gwagwalada Area Council, FCT. Mrs Abigail Bawa, Coordinator, MGI, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in an interview in Abuja, that the aim was to provide free medical services for the less privileged in the area. “We started this free medical service long time ago to assist the poor; I am doing it to help those who cannot pay for their medical bill. “I know what it takes to pay for medical treatment in some families, and I know what the people in the rural communities are facing, especially at this hard time. “Many people have died because they could not have afford to pay for their treatment; that is why we took it upon ourselves to assist the rural communities,” she said. Bawa said the organisation would visit as many communities as they could in the area council, adding that communities with difficult terrain would be visited with motorcycles. “We will continue to render free medical service, especially to people at the rural areas as long as we have the means to do so. “All fingers are not equal but I am calling on well-meaning Nigerians to come out and assist those who are helpless.” The coordinator promised to continue with the goodwill gesture and urged other relevant stakeholders in the society to do the same within their domains. One of the beneficiaries, Mrs Sarah Kaka, who could not hide her joy, expressed gratitude to the organisation for the kind gesture. “I am happy for this malaria treatment and dental check-up because I don’t have money to go to hospital,” she said. NAN reports that the medical outreach featured dental, eye screening and malaria tests from qualified doctors. (NAN)
