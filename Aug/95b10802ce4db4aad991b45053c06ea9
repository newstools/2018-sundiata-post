By Teniola Ibitola Lagos – An Ebute Meta Magistrates’ Court sitting in Lagos, on Monday, admitted two men, Idris Ibrahim, 44, and Segun Bernard, 50, who are facing a murder charge, to bail. The duo were brought before the court on a two-count charge of murder and reckless driving. Their plea was not taken. In her ruling, the magistrate, Mrs O.A. Olagbende, said that the court had no probable cause to remand the accused, and accordingly released them on bail. The magistrate adjourned the case until Oct. 29. The Prosecutor, ASP Clara Olagbayi, had told the court that the offences were committed on July 26, at about 8.30 p.m., at the Iganmu Bridge. The charge sheet read that Ibrahim, a motorcyclist, had murdered Akeem Bashiru, 45, by pushing him on to an oncoming vehicle, while Benard, a driver of a truck had caused the death of the deceased by running his truck over him. “The deceased had used his car to hit Ibrahim’s motorcycle from behind, an argument ensued when they both parked by the road side to argue on why the deceased had driven recklessly. “After much arguments, the deceased tried to cross the road carelessly and was hit by Bernard, who was driving a Benz truck with reg number JJJ 860 XK. “He also had his head smashed when the truck climbed over his head,’’ the prosecutor said. The prosecutor said the offences contravened Section 224 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 and Section 20 of the Road Traffic Law of Lagos State, 2015. (NAN)
