By Obinna Unaeze Minna –   Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa, former Sokoto governor, who is aspiring for the PDP ticket to contest the 2019 elections, says he would not leave the party if he loses in the primary election. “I will remain in the PDP even I do not emerge its presidential flag bearer; as a democrat, I allow the people’s will to prevail. In every race, there is always a winner and loser,” Bafarawa said on Monday in Minna. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Bafarawa spoke at a meeting with the Niger State delegates of the party ahead of the PDP national convention slated for Oct. 5-6. “I am a democrat that believes in playing according to the rules of the game. I am not a desperate politician. “There are people that joined the party to become State Governors or President. That, to me, is selfish. “The interest of Nigeria and the PDP must come first. My personal ambition is last. Whether I succeed as PDP presidential aspirant or not, I will remain in the party and support the winner to ensure success,” he said. He called for unity among PDP members, saying that only a united front could defeat the APC and move Nigeria forward. Bafarawa cautioned Nigerians seeking political offices against seeing such bids as “a matter of life and death”, saying that making Nigeria a better nation should be the principal concern. The aspirant urged the delegates to vote for him during the national convention, and promised to implement policies that would make Nigeria a great nation. Responding, Mr Tanko Beji, PDP chairman in the state, said that there were 202 delegates from Niger, and promised to consider aspirants based on their individual merit. Other PDP members seeking its presidential ticket are former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, former Kaduna and Kano governors, Ahmed Makarfi and Sule Lamido, as well as the governors of Gombe and Sokoto States, Dankwambo and Aminu Tambuwal.
