By Ige Adekunle  Sango-Ota     –       The Ogun Command of Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned motorists to desist from speeding at construction sites to avoid accidents and deaths. Mr Clement Oladele, the Ogun Sector Commander, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Ota, Ogun State. Oladele said that the advice became imperative as most of the crashes recorded in the second quarter of 2018 which led to loss of over 160 lives occurred at construction areas. He listed some of the construction areas in Ogun to include Mowe, Ogunmakin and Ibafo on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. “People need to change their attitude and adhere to the 50 km speed limit, especially at most of the construction areas,’’ Oladele said. The sector commander said that infrastructure development should not be an excuse for loss of lives in the state. Oladele, however, commended the Federal Government and Ogun State Government for the infrastructure development and advised motorists to be safety conscious to prevent unnecessary loss of lives and property.
