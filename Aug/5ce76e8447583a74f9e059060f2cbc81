By Emmanuel Oloniruha  Abuja –  The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged British Prime Minister, Mrs Theresa May, to demand free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria in 2019, during her scheduled visit to the country. The party made the call in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Tuesday in Abuja. It said that the advice was important as there were apprehensions across Nigeria on the elections following actions, utterances “and body language’’ of ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). It also urged May to intervene on interferences and violent attacks on the National Assembly as well as the threats to forcefully remove elected presiding officers of the Senate. The party called on the British leader to use her stay in the country to visit some parts to ascertain the true situation of issues. It said that the Federal Government had penchant for disobedience of court orders, unlawful political arrests and detention, restriction of free speech and media freedom. Other areas of drawbacks on the part of government, according to it, are lack of accountability as detailed in report by various international bodies, including Transparency International (TI), Amnesty International (AI) and US Department of States.
