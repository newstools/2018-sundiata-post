By Nabilu Balarabe  Hadejia    –     Two residents of Chadi in Hadejia Local Government Council of Jigawa on Thursday expressed concern over three bent electricity poles in the area. They told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Hadejia that the worn-out poles posed a threat to the lives and property of the residents. Mallam Abdullahi Garba, a businessman in the area, said he was living in fear because the poles could easily fall during rainstorm and electrocute passersby. Another resident, Bala Mohammed, a tailor, also expressed displeasure at the state of the poles. He said that the poles were put in place a very long time ago and should no longer be in use. “Kano Electricity Distribution Company must take responsibility in case of eventualities. “These poles were installed since 1976. Therefore, it is unthinkable that they are still being used now,” Mohammed said. When contacted, the KEDC Manager, Hadejia Branch, Alhaji Sani Abubakar, said arrangements had been concluded to replace some low tension poles in Chadi area. He said that the company had already replaced over 100 poles in 14 local government councils under the branch, especially in Gumel, Garki, Maigatari and Babura. The manager appealed to the residents to bear with the company, as it was doing its best to serve them better.
