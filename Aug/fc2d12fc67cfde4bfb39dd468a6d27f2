By Sunday John  Lafia,   –      The Nasarawa State chapter of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), is to organise a workshop to sensitise members on the need to embrace peace, its Chairman, Alhaji Hassan Husaini, has disclosed. Husaini told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Lafia that the workshop was part of the measures initiated by MACBAN national leadership to educate cattle breeders on advantages of peaceful co-existence. “I recently attended a workshop on conflict resolution skills organised by the Federal and Nasarawa State governments; my intention is to use the workshop to step-down what we were taught,” Husaini said. He said that officials of the association from the 13 local government and 18 Development Areas would participate in the workshop to be held in Lafia. Husaini blamed the rising insincerity in the country on bad leadership at all levels of government, saying that the situation was worsened by the insincerity among religious and traditional leaders as well as government officials. “If all leaders in the country become sincere in their approach to issues, there will be peace and harmony,” he said. He said that MACBAN would soon embark on a sensitisation tour of its communities to educate members on the dangers of taking laws into their hands. Husaini also commended the Nasarawa State government for stepping up efforts to unite the people and promote mutual trust across tribal, religious and political lines. He advised MACBAN members with grievances to always use civilised means to seek redress.
