By Idris Abdulrahman  Mina (Saudi Arabia)   –    The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has threatened to penalise any of the caterers, who violates its pilgrims’ feeding arrangements, during the Hajj in Saudi Arabia. The commission’s Chairman, Abdullahi Muhktar, gave the threat while inspecting catering and accommodation services for pilgrims on Wednesday in Mina, Saudi Arabia. Mukhtar had, while inspecting the catering service in Kwara camp, discovered that the company handling it failed to adhere to NAHCON’s menu for dinner. The menu had provided for a meal of rice, stew, fruits and drinks but the contractors prepared three slices of bread and small quantities of beans for each pilgrim. The NAHCON boss immediately directed the caterers to provide the stipulated dish and serve the beans to pilgrims, who wanted it at no cost to the commission. He said NAHCON would penalise such companies because pilgrims deserved the best service for their money. “ These meals are not free, the pilgrims paid for them and I see no reason to compromise their welfare,’’ Mukhtar said. Addressing the pilgrims and their officials later, the NAHCON boss assured them of the commission’s dedication to their welfare. He urged all pilgrims to intensify prayers for Nigeria, President Buhari, their governors and relations for Nigeria to prosper. He also inspected similar facilities in the kaduna, Kogi, Ekiti, Zamfara, Kano and Sokoto state camps where he delegated some staff of the commission to ensure the caterers complied with the feeding regulations. Mukhtar later told newsmen that the commission was ready to improve on the shortcomings observed during the visits. He commended all the officials and staff of each state he visited, adding that NAHCON was proud of their efforts in realising hitch-free Hajj.
