By Bolaji Buhari  Lagos   –     Chief Adeseye Ogunlewe, a former Minister of Works and chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), on Sunday called on party members in Lagos State to pray for peace and unity in their fold. Ogunlewe, a former senator, said without peace and unity the party could not rise above its present “challenges” toward realising its goal of winning the state in 2019. “What is needed in Lagos State PDP is prayers, prayers and prayers. “Members in the chapter should pray together for peace and unity so that the goals of the party can be actualised. “Members must particularly unite at this challenging period in order to get victory in 2019,’’ the PDP chieftain told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Ogunlewe who described the recent killing at the party’s rally in Eti-Osa area of the state as unfortunate, said divine intervention was needed to avert a recurrence. NAN reports that some hoodlums had on July 21 invaded the party’s rally at Eti-Osa, killing the Chairman of the Apapa Chapter of the party, Mr Adeniyi Aborishade. The invasion by the hoodlums and subsequent violence followed disagreements among members at the rally. The Police arrested the State PDP Chairman, Mr Moshood Salvador and 10 other chieftains and on July 25, charged them with murder at a Yaba Magistrates’ Court. They all pleaded not guilty to the two-count charge of unlawful killing and criminal conspiracy. Chief Magistrate Oyetade Komolafe had remanded Salvador and others in prison and adjourned the case until Aug. 27 for advice from the State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP).
