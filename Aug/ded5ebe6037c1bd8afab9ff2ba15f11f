By Glory Abuh-Adejoh  Abuja   –        A Wuse Zone 6 Chief Magistrates’ Court in Abuja on Friday sentenced a 20-year-old man, Mohammed Tahir, to one month imprisonment for converting his neighbour’s phones to his personal use. Tahir of Automotive Car wash, Garki 2, Abuja, was sentenced on a count charge of criminal misappropriation, an offence he admitted committing. The Magistrate, Abdulmajid Oniyangi, however, gave the convict N2, 000 option of fine. Oniyangi said the court was lenient because the accused had no record of previous conviction. He, however, warned the convict to be of good behaviour and desist from criminal activities. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Joshua Ayanna, had told the court that one Peniniah Ugonyork of Garki International Market, Abuja, reported the matter at Garki Police Station on May 15. Ayanna said that Ugonyork, on May 15, forgot her Huawei X7 Prime and Techno WX3 mobile phones on a table outside her shop. The prosecutor said the convict found the phones and kept them for his personal use instead of returning them to her. He said that the phones were found with the convict during police investigation. Ayanna said the convict also admitted to have committed the offence. The prosecutor said that the offence contravened provision of Section 309 of the Penal Code. Following the plea of the convict, the prosecutor prayed the court to try him summarily under Section 118 (2) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act and he was sentenced accordingly.
