By Abiemwense Moru  Abuja   –   The Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki and the Speaker, House of Representatives, Mr Yakubu Dogara, said on Tuesday that no date had been fixed for the two chambers to reconvene to consider the INEC 2019 elections budget request forwarded by President Muhammadu Buhari. This was contained in a statement by Mr Yusuph Olaniyonu, Special Adviser on Media and Publicity to Senate President and Mr Turaki Hassan, Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs to Speaker, House of Representatives in Abuja. The Senate president and the speaker said that no meeting between the two chambers took place to consider any report before the National Assembly. “Until the committees has a ready report for the consideration of the two chambers, it will be most irresponsible to recall members from recess, especially those that may have travelled to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj,” they said. Buhari forwarded the INEC 2019 elections budget request on July 17. The Joint Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Electoral Matters and officials of the INEC ought to have met on or before Monday Aug. 13. The joint committees were also expected to meet with the joint Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, Loans and Debts on the Eurobond loan request after which two reports would have been ready for presentation in the two chambers.
