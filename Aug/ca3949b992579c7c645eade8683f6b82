By Akeem Abas Ibadan –  Gov. Abiola Ajimobi has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be more proactive on its Continuous Voter Registration(CVR) to check disenfranchisement of eligible voters. The governor made the call on Tuesday in Ibadan while receiving Mr Mutiu Agboke, the State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), in his office. Ajimobi said he was aware of several complaints from residents on factors hindering many eligible voters to obtain their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs). He listed some of the factors as slow pace of work, long queues, shortage of personnel and non-availability of INEC officials at designated locations. The governor stressed on the need for the commission to engage more personnel to speed up the process while giving an assurance that the state government would support the commission to sensitise the people. Ajimobi said that the confidence of the public in INEC was about 50 percent, urging it to raise the bar and ensure electoral transparency in the state. The governor promised that the state government would give work-free hours on specific days for public servants to participate in the process. Earlier, Agboke stated that about 756,450 PVC were yet to be collected in the state. He appealed to the state government to encourage public servants in the state by setting a day aside for the collection of PVCs. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a document on the strategic action plan of INEC was presented to the governor.  (NAN)
