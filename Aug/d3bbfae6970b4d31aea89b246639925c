By Raji Rasak  Badagry     –      A 40-year-old applicant, Taofik Badmus, was on Friday docked in a Badagry Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos State, for alleged stealing of N500,000. The prosecutor, Mr Akpan Ikem, told the court that the defendant, at 10.00 a.m. in March 2014, and at noon in July 2016, at Magbon, Badagry, obtained money under false pretext. Ikem alleged that the accused collected N250,000 from one Abibatu Salami and another N250,000 from Amuda Ganiyu, with a promise of selling a plot of land to them. He said that the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Patrick Adekomaya, granted the accused bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties in like sum. He adjourned the matter until Sept. 5 for hearing.
