By Olajide Idowu  Osogbo –  The Police Command in Osun has smashed three suspected gangs of commercial motorcycle snatchers who specialise in stealing their victims’ motorcycles after killing them. The Commissioner of Police, Mr Fimihan Adeoye, disclosed this to Journalists in Osogbo on Friday. Adeoye said two of the gangs had killed their victims after snatching their motorcycles. Adeoye said one Mutiu Azeez, 37, an ex-convict, who had spent 14 years in prison, conspired with one Afolabi Muyiwa, 31, and stole a commercial motorcycle in Iragbiji, Osun, on Monday. He said they committed the dastardly act after tying the owner to a tree and killing him by smashing his head with a stone. He said another gang comprising of one Opeyemi Adeyinka, 18 and Isiaka Azeez, 21, was also arrested on Wednesday after its members snatched a motorcycle from it’s owner in Ila, Osun, killing their victim with a cutlass. The commissioner said the third member of the gang who was using the motorcycle for commercial business after it was stolen, was, however, killed after he was knocked down in Ile-Ife by a trailer when he was riding the motorcycle. He said a third gang comprising a 21-year-old man and a 28-year-old man, who had been snatching motorcycles in the Modakeke/Ife axis, was also smashed by the police team on July 31. He said arrested alongside the suspects were three other persons (including the wife of a stolen goods buyer) who were the buyers of motorcycles stolen by the suspects. Adeoye said he had met with commercial motorcycles unions and operators in the state and had warned them to be mindful and be extra vigilant with the kind of passengers they picked and were they took them to. He said the suspects were being investigated and would be charged to court afterward. (NAN)
