By Salisu Sani-Idris Abuja –   The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) has expressed strong disapproval of the blockade of the National Assembly by security operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS). The National Secretary of NUJ, Shuaibu Leman, in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja, described the action as “primitive, reckless and a clear sabotage of the nation’s democratic process”. “ While we commend the swift reaction of the Acting President in sacking the Director-General of the DSS, Alhaji Lawal Daura, we, however believe more needs to be done and quickly too in fishing out all those involved in that dastardly act and punishing them accordingly. According to Leman, the major factor heating up the political atmosphere in the country is the excessive quest for power over who gets what by our politicians instead of working assiduously to ameliorate the condition of the suffering masses. “It is long overdue for our leadership to overhaul the security architecture of the country to make it work in tandem with the principles of democracy and social equality,” he said.
