By Ismaila Chafe  Abuja –  President Muhammadu Buhari has  congratulated the matriarch of the Elumelu family, Mrs Suzanne Elumelu, on her 90th birthday. The President’s congratulatory message is contained in a statement issued by the President’s Special Adviser, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Friday. President Buhari joined family and friends of the “kind-hearted and loving mother of five, including Chairman of Heirs Foundation, Tony Elumelu, in celebrating the milestone, which is an evidence of God’s favour and grace.” The President commended Mrs Elumelu, who is fondly called Mama, for her strength of character and entrepreneurial spirit in raising a strong and healthy family. He also commended her advocacy for good education and investment for children and women particularly. President Buhari believed Mama’s life story of succeeding against the odds of early widowhood would continue to  serve as an inspiration to many. According to him, her virtues of the fear of God, discipline, integrity, dedication and hard work will continue to resonate among the communities of the less privileged that she supports and regularly encourages. The President prayed that God would grant Mama Elumelu, the Adadioranma of Onicha Ugbo, Delta State, longer life, filled with joy and good health.  (NAN).
