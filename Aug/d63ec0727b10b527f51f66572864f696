By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja {Sundiata Post} –  Former Head of State, Ibrahim Babangida has revealed his choice of candidate for the 2019 presidential election.  The ex-military leader made his choice known in his Hilltop residence in Minna, Niger State on Saturday.  A former Caretaker Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sen. Ahmed Makarfi and his presidential campaign team had visited Babangida to get his blessings ahead of the PDP presidential primary.  Other notable candidates believed to be interested in the party’s presidential ticket are former Vice President Atiku Abubakar; former Jigawa Governor, Sule Lamido; former Kano Governor, Sen. Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso; Gombe Governor, Ibrahim Dankwambo and Sokoto Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, who recently left the APC for the PDP.  But addressing Makarfi and his team, Babangida was quoted by Vanguard as saying, “Without fear or favour, you have made my day.  “We need a new narrative in this country. We can’t go on like we used to. We need an articulated vision of a new Nigeria. I am not surprised that you give such narrative of the country. You did well in the legislature and you handled well one of the most civilised and sophisticated states in Nigeria.  “You have my blessings and I will look forward to hearing from you on some of these articulations I heard from you today. Honestly I feel so proud.  “I was almost losing hope in the country, as a military man I wouldn’t. But having heard from the distinguished senator, I have become more enlightened and emboldened to say we have hope in Nigeria.”
