By Suleiman Shehu  Ibadan –  A former Chief Security Officer of the Polytechnic, Ibadan, Ahmed Olalekan, has been shot dead by suspected cultists who traced him to his residence in Apete, Ibadan. Olalekan, a graduate of the institution was shot on the neck on Monday by the suspected membesr of the dreaded Aiye Confraternity of Nigeria. An eyewitness told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan on Tuesday that the suspected assailants inflicted some machete cuts on the deceased before they fled. The death of the chief security office who had been behind the clampdown on cultism in the institution, enraged his colleagues who blocked vehicular traffic along the Sango-Eleyele road, Ibadan. NAN gathered that some members of the Apete Youths Forum also protested against the killing of Olalekan, their member, in the premises of the institution on Tuesday. When NAN visited the institution only few students were on campus while virtually all the lecture halls were empty. The school security operatives were on patrol with some posted at strategic locations to prevent breakdown of law and order. Confirming the incident, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Oyo State, ASP Adekunel Ajisebutu, said some policemen had been deployed to the campus to maintain law and order. Ajisebutu said some arrests were made and exhibits such as axes and cutlasses recovered. The PPRO said the state Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Odude, had directed that discrete investigation into the incident be carried out and the suspects arrested be charged to court. (NAN)
