By Ugochi Ugochukwu  Abuja   –     A Kado Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Monday sentenced two scavengers to three months imprisonment for stealing two window protectors and an iron rod. The convicts, Salisu Yakubu, 22, and Kabiru Salisu, 18, had pleaded guilty to a three-count charge of joint act, criminal trespass and theft. The Judge, Alhaji Ahmed Ado, however, gave each of them N5, 000 option of fine for the offence of joint act and criminal trespass. Ado did not give the convicts an option of fine on the count of theft and held that they were not first time offenders. He said that the punishment would serve as deterrent to others. The Prosecutor, Judith Obatomi, had told the court that one Aina Suru of Housing Estate, Gwarinpa, Abuja, reported the matter at the Life Camp Police Station on Aug. 8. Obatomi said the convicts committed the offences at about 5 a.m. at Gwarinpa. She said that they criminally trespassed into the complainant’s building site through the fence and stole two window burglary proofs and a long iron rod. She told the court that the convicts took the stolen items and hid them inside a nearby bush. The prosecutor said that during police investigation the convicts made confessional statements. She said the offences contravened Sections 79, 348 and 287 of the Penal Code.
