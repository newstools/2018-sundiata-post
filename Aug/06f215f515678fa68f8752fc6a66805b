By Akeem Abas  Ibadan   –     The lawmaker representing Iseyin/Iwajowa/Kajola/Itesiwaju federal constituency in Oyo state, Mr Abiodun Olasupo, and the Iseyin monarch, Oba AbdulGaniyu Salahudeen, have bemoaned delay in the reconstruction of Moniya-Iseyin road. In separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Iseyin on Wednesday, they called on Oyo State Government to ensure speedy completion of the project. NAN recalls that Gov. Abiola Ajimobi recently awarded the reconstruction of the road. Olasupo, who lamented the slow pace of work on the road, said that the contractor was yet to commence real construction work. He stated that Oke-Ogun area of the state with an agrarian population needed basic infrastructure such as good road network. “My constituency is agrarian and infrastructure, particularly road network, is basic,” the lawmaker said. Also, Oba Salaudeen, who thanked Gov. Ajimobi for awarding the reconstruction of Moniya-Iseyin road, also lamented the slow pace of work on it. The monarch said that the road and some others in the region had suffered neglect from successive administrations. He appealed for speedy completion of the road in order to aid movement of produce from farms to markets. An Iseyin-based socio-cultural group, Ebedi Frontliners, also called on the governor to expedite action on the road project. The group said in a letter to the governor: “This is the road that links the state capital to Oke-Ogun zone and some other parts of the state. “Its existence is important to transport farm produce to the market and even for export.”
