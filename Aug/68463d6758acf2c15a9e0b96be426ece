By Victor Okoye  Abuja,   –       Chris Giwa, a factional President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), on Monday commended the Falconets for picking a quarter final ticket at the ongoing FIFA U20 Women’s World Cup in France. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Falconets scored deep in added time to level matters at 1-1 at the end of regulation time. Ajibade scored the goal in the 95th minute to cancel out China’s Zhang Linyan’s 41st minute goal. Giwa, in a statement by Victor Iroele, his Senior Special Assistant on Media, noted that the girls gave their all till the very end and got the equaliser needed to progress from the group. “We are happy the girls qualified; that is what is most important for us. It was definitely going to be a tough and difficult game for the Falconets, considering what was at stake. “The Chinese dominated the first half and seemed to have played better; but our girls knew what was important, picking a point and progressing, and that was what they did. “We have crossed the group hurdle and can now look ahead to the next match and hope the coaches will work on some of the lapses noticed in the game before our next match.” Also, the Giwa-led NFF factional Acting General Secretary, Emmanuel Ikpeme, described the qualification of the Falconets as a demonstration of hard work, determination and can-do-spirit of the average Nigerian. “I am very proud of the girls because they held on till the end, even when the odds were against them, and the reward for their efforts was the draw that was needed for the quarter final ticket. “From now on, anything is possible with hard work and determination; our girls can have the better of their next opponents in the quarter finals and hopefully, progress to the semis,” Ikpeme said.
