By Tukur Muntari Karaye (Kano State) –   Brig.-Gen. Suleiman Kazaure, the Director-General, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has charged corps members to engage in small-scale businesses after their service year to enable them to be self-reliant. Kazaure gave the advice on Friday when he paid an inspection visit to the NYSC permanent orientation camp in Kusalla, Karaye Local Government Area of Kano State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NYSC director-general was in Kano State to inspect the ongoing orientation course of 2018 Batch ‘B’ Stream II. He enjoined the corps members to participate actively in all camp activities and avoid unnecessary travels throughout the service year. Kazaure said that in an effort to address accommodation challenges confronting corps members, the agency would request state governments to build corpers’ lodge in each of the 774 local government areas across the nation. The NYSC boss, who cautioned the corps members against patronising nightclubs, urged them to shun all acts of indiscipline and immorality. The director-general commended the state of facilities in the camp and urged the management of the NYSC in the state to ensure that they were properly maintained. He said that as part of efforts to improve the welfare of the corps members, the Federal Government had recently increased their transportation and feeding allowances. Earlier, the state NYSC Coordinator, Alhaji Ladan Baba, said that over 2,100 corps members for Borno and Kano states were registered in the camp.  (NAN)
