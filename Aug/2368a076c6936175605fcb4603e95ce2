By Adekunle Williams Lagos –  Hon. Olawale Olayiwola, the Lagos State House of Assembly member for Mushin Constituency II, on Thursday, appealed to people in the constituency to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) to elect their representatives in the 2019 election. Olayiwola made the appeal at the 4th and final edition of the annual constituency stakeholders meeting in Mushin, Lagos State with the theme “Toward Peaceful and Credible Elections.” The meeting was simultaneously held in all the constituencies of the state. The Mushin constituency lawmaker said “the 2019 election is knocking at the door and we are currently embarking on campaign to encourage the electorate to collect their PVC. “PVC is like blood line toward the 2019 election and you know that without blood, human beings cannot survive so also without PVC, we will not be able to elect our leaders in the general elections.” Olayiwola said that the stakeholders meeting was to enable elected representatives to take feedback from their various constituencies, adding that members would also report to the constituency what they had been able to do in the past three years of their legislature. He added that “the purpose of this meeting was to ensure that our people got meaningful representation through good governance. “Secondly, we want to ensure that there is more conducive environment be created for credible elections in 2019. “Most importantly, we need to acquaint the constituents of efforts of the assembly in ensuring that the government of the state further delivers on the welfare and security of citizens.” The lawmaker explained that he had in the past three years moved 30 motions and co-sponsored 29 motions. He said virtually all the motions had impacted on the socio-economic development of the people of the state.
