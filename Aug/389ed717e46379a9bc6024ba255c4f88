By Okon Okon  Abuja    –    The water resources regulatory agency, Nigeria Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC), says Federal Government is working toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Six. Mr Peter Henry, a member of the coordination team from NIWRMC, spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Abuja. Henry said that the Federal Government had recently established a coordination team toward ensuring access to water and sanitation for all. NAN reports that SDG 6 is target at achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) for all by 2030. “The Federal Government sees the need to establish a coordination team, hence the inauguration of the team, which will coordinate mechanisms for the implementation of the goal six in the sector. “This will form a strong regional coordination through effective partnership with water-related organisations like Niger Basin Authority (NBA), Lake Chad Basin Commission and Regional Centre for Integrated River Basin Management. “This will also foster the desired synergy among stakeholders and agencies saddled with the responsibility of implementing water-related projects for the attainment of SDG Six. “This will, therefore, ensure the availability and sustainable management of safely managed water and sanitation for all by 2030,’’ he said. Henry further explained that the team for the achievement of SDG Six had noted reasons why Nigeria could not achieve the targets of the millennium Development Goals (MDGs). He said that there was need to involve all stakeholders in the water sector to map out strategies to meet with the global demand of SDG Six. “Although, substantial progress was made to meet MDGs, but sizeable percentage of the populations do not have access to improve WASH facilities. “Nigerians are still drawing water from unprotected sources, hence the need for improvement,’’ he said.
