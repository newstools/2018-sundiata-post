By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  Former Minister of Aviation, Chief Femi-Fani Kayode on Monday wrote to the police asking for shift in date of the interview from 28th of August to 4th or 5th of September and also informed that the invitation is vague and ambiguous. He also reminded that the invitation is clashing with the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Conference which he is playing active part in. Fani-Kayode who wrote through his counsel said:  “In view of the short notice apparent in your letter under reference, our client is constrained to politely request for a rescheduling of the interview date and also that he be furnished  with essential  particulars of the purpose  of his visit to your office so as to adequately prepare for the said interview. “Our client shall in the circumstance be requesting  that the appointment be resheduled to either 4th or 5th day of September , 2018, subject to the convenience of your office and officers. The request is necessitated by the fact that our client already has earlier scheduled programmes that borders on some urgent and crucial matters already lined up for this week including the on-going Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Conference, which Conference our Client is participating and hosting a number of delegates. These might make it difficult or rather impossible for him to honour the invitation on the scheduled date. Sundiata Post recalls that the police had in a letter dated 20th August 2018, invited Chief Femi-Fani Kayode to appear before for a fact-finding interview over alleged conspiracy, criminal defamation, inciting, publication, injurious falsehood and conduct likely to cause breach of peace.
