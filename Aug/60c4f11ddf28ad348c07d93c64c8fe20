By Gabriel Yough  Jalingo,   –     A member of the Taraba Business Community, Alhaji Sani Baba, on Thursday urged Taraba Government to engage graduates in its mechanised farming to check unemployment. Baba, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, SBG Global Services, said that graduates of College of Agriculture, Jalingo, should be involved in the scheme. He gave the advice at an interaction with journalists in Jalingo. He said that the state government would set aside large expanse of land for crops and animal production in the three senatorial districts and engage the graduates to work on the farms. According to him, portions of the farms can be shared to youths to cultivate different types of crops and government should be ready to buy off from them after harvest to encourage them. “Taraba and Rivers Governments can partner to produce rice, cassava and others crops to boost their economy. “Today, Lagos and Kebbi are partnering to produce Lake Rice and you can see that the result is wonderful. “We need to think beyond oil and find ways of improving our economy,” Baba said. He commended the Taraba Green House project, noting that the huge amount of money spent on it could have engaged over 4,000 youths in farming and the result could be far better. “The governor can do well to meet the business community and interface with us on how to implement some of his policies, especially those that have to do with empowerment and economy of the state,” Baba said. He explained that if agriculture was given its rightful place, Taraba would soon become self-reliant.
