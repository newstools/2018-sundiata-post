By Kemi Ajayi Lagos –  The Delta Sports Commission says it has put measures in place to maintain and sustain the Stephen Keshi International Stadium, venue of the just-concluded 2018 Africa Senior Athletics Championships in Asaba. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the over 20,000-capacity stadium hosted over 1,000 athletes from 52 countries that took part in the five-day event. The Chairman of the Commission, Tony Okowa, told NAN that the a company that specialised in facility maintenance had been given the task. He noted that the lack of good maintenance culture was responsible for some of the dilapidated sports facilities in the country. “We already have plans in place to maintain the stadium, in this part of the world we lack maintenance culture but that will not be the case with this stadium. “A professional company has been contracted with the task of maintaining the facility, the football pitch will always be maintained. “We have three boreholes on the football pitch, dry season or no dry season, the grass will always remain green, all these and more are the plans on ground to keep the facility in shape. NAN reports that the stadium was named after the late Stephen Keshi, a former Super Eagles player and coach who won the Africa Cup of Nations as a player and coach. (NAN)
