By Leonard Okachie  Umuhia   –     Journalists in Abia on Thursday joined their counterparts across the country to protest incessant attacks and molestation of media professionals. The protest is in line with a directive of the national leadership of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ). The journalists marched round the union’s secretariat at Number 1 Aba Road, as well as round the Umuahia Tower, near the post office in the state capital. The protesters carried placards with different inscriptions including, “Kill Journalism, Kill Democracy,” “Enough is Enough, Journalism is not a Crime” and “We say No to Impunity against Media.” In his brief remarks, the Chairman of the state council, John Emejor, recalled some instances where journalists in the country were killed, harassed, molested and beaten up by security operatives. He specifically mentioned the recent demolition of Fresh FM (Music House) Ibadan, Oyo State, by the State Government. Other speakers at the protest include, former Director, Broadcasting Corporation of Abia, Mr Ogbonnaya Iheaka and a former broadcaster and retired Permanent Secretary in the state, Mr Chimdi Oluoha. In their separate speeches, they condemned the act of violence being meted to media professionals in the country, describing such acts as inimical to democracy. The News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN) reports that the NUJ chairman, read the letter from the national secretariat to President Muhammadu Buhari, which was later dispatched to Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu.
