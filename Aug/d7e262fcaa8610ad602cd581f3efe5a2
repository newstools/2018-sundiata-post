By Emmanuel Mogbede  Abuja –  The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned the blockade of the National Assembly by masked DSS operatives and dissociated itself from the development. The party in a statement issued by its acting National Publicity, Yekini Nabena said it is law abiding. “Our party wholly dissociates itself from any act of brigandage and affront on the sacred symbols of our budding democracy. “Our party remains a law abiding political organisation and advises every constituent part to abide by the tenets of our constitution and our democracy. “Whilst our contention with the leadership of the National Assembly as currently constituted is a matter of public record, we still believe that the legislature as an independent arm of government must be allowed free reign,”it said. This,it said was critical for vibrant contestation of ideas and values amongst its members within the context of their constitutional mandate and for the benefit of the Nigerian people. The statement, however, called for a more harmonious working relationship between the various arms of government in the general interest of the country. The APC in an earlier statement, had said that the development at the National Assembly was strictly a legislative matter. It stressed that the party’s National Chairman,Mr Adams Oshiomhole should not be dragged into the matter. It added that the party was monitoring the developments in the National Assembly like every other concerned Nigerian and stakeholder. (NAN)
