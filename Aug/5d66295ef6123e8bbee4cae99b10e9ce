The defendants, who reside at ijeshatedo, Mushin, Lagos, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges and were granted bail in the sum of N50, 000 each, with one surety each in like sum.
Tanimola said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
The case was adjourned until Sept. 3 for mention. The prosecutor, Insp. Aondohemba Koti, had told the court that the defendants committed the offences on July 28 at their residence.
He said that the accused persons and others still at large conspired and beat up four staff of EKEDC while performing their duties.
“They beat up Mr Yeye Sunday, Morenikeji Olatunji, Stephen Odanyor and Ibrahim Omolere.”
Koti said that the complainants disconnected the electricity supply because the house owed huge amount of money.
“The accused persons, who live in the same house are owing N233,000 which prompted the complainants to disconnect the building’s power supply.”
The prosecutor said that the defendants also conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause breach of peace by unlawfully seizing the official ladder.
According to the prosecutor, the case was reported, while the defendants were arrested and the ladder recovered.
The offences violated Sections 168, 173 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 173 stipulates three years imprisonment for assault, while Section 411 prescribes two years for conspiracy.
