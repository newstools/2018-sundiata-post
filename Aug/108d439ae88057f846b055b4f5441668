By Ugonne Uzoma  Owerr    –       Gov. Rochas Okorocha of Imo on Saturday warned politicians and political parties against politicising the issue of Permanent Voters’ Cards (PVC) collection in the state. Okorocha, in a statement, said that the state had not done well on the issue of registration and collection of PVCs when compared with the records of some other states. The statement was signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Sam Onwuemeodo in Owerri. He said that the state had no fewer than 480,000 uncollected PVCs and countless of unregistered persons. The governor, therefore, urged politicians and political parties in the state to set aside political sentiments and play their part in ensuring that Imo people got their PVCs in the remaining days left for the exercise. The governor had on Thursday declared Aug. 15 and Aug. 16 work-free, to enable eligible voters in the state to register and also collect their PVCs. “Markets, shops and other related ventures will remain closed until 4pm,’’ he said Okorocha, however, urged traditional rulers, churches and community leaders to ensure that their people have their PVCs.
