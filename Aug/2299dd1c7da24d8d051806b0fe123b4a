By Emmanuel Oloniruha Abuja –  Chief Olu Falae, the National Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) has condemned Tuesday blockade of the National Assembly by operatives of the Department of State Services. In a statement issued by the party National Publicity Secretary, Alfa Mohammed, on Tuesday in Abuja, Falae said the action breached the nation’s constitution. According to the statement, the incident was an open breach of the nation’s 1999 constitution as amended, which enjoins separation of powers and independence of the legislature. “We are gradually being pushed to a state of anarchy due to the desperation of the government in power to force a change in the leadership of the Senate. “This conduct amounts to assault on Democracy which we risked our lives and fought for. “It is also a declaration by government that we can all take the law into our own hands”. The Federal Government has already dissociated itself from the blockade and sacked the director-general of the DSS, Lawal Daura, who authorised it, without the prior knowledge of the presidency. Acting President Yemi Osinbajo also condemned the action as a gross violation of constitutional order, rule of law and all accepted notions of law and order. According to him, the unlawful act which was done without the knowledge of the Presidency is condemnable and completely unacceptable. An Acting DG has been named for the agency. He is Mathew B. Seiyefa, from Bayelsa State. (NAN)
