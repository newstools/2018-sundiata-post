By Abiodun Esan  Ilorin   –     Former Chairman, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara, Akogun Oyedepo, has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would defeat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2019 general elections in the state. Oyedepo, who  recently led majority of PDP members to APC, said on Sunday in Ilorin in a statement after a meeting of his group that over 85 per cent of PDP members followed him to decamp to APC. “If you add our 85 per cent with the people in APC before we came in, the party is richer now and ready to chase away PDP in Kwara,” he said. He said that members of the splinter group that remained in PDP had no electoral value, adding that APC was the party to beat in any election in Kwara. According to him, only four members of the PDP executives out of 31 members remained with the party, adding that the rest followed him to APC. Oyedepo also said that 27 of the PDP executive members were now with him in APC. According to him, the four executive members that choose to remain are from a splinter group loyal to the Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki. The former PDP chairman also said that over 85 per cent of the local government and ward executive followed him to APC. Oyedepo, a lawyer, said that not less than 15 other political parties were ready to work with APC to wrestle power form PDP and Saraki. “I can boast of 15 political parties that are with us. As far as that is concerned, we have not less than 15 that are working with us. KOWA is with us, we are with Labour Party, PPN and many others.”
