By Chiazo Ogbolu  Lagos   –    An Information and Communication Technology (ICT) expert, Mr Jide Awe, has called for the bridging of gap existing between the legislature and the technology communities. Awe made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Wednesday. According to him, bridging the gap will ensure the growth and sustainability of the technology communities. He added that the legislature should be part of the enabling environment that would enhance the growth of the technology communities. “The legislature is far from the technology community and so whenever members in such communities are summoned for one thing or the others, they feel threatened. “They are supposed to help such communities in areas that will enable them boost the industry.But right now, most people in industry are far from them, no form of interaction at all,” he said. He said that to bridge that gap, the legislature must first create an avenue to listen to the technology community. The expert said that the regular interaction would enable the legislature to know the problem and concerns of the community and help proffer solutions. “There are many issues facing the technology community which need attention and there are some areas where the industry is working with the executives. “If a room is given for interaction between the technology communities and the legislature, their various issues will be resolved.” Awe also called on the legislature could do more to enact and implement laws encouraging the industry to do more for its growth and for the benefit of the country. He said that the slow implementation of laws such as the Cybersecurity Act was not good for the country as it slowed development. “There is need for proper sensitisation and regular industry engagement to ensure bridging the gap between legislature and technology community.”
