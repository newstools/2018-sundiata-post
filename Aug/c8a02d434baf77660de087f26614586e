By Collins Yakubu-Hammer  Abuja –   Mr Danielson Akpan, National President, National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), has ordered the immediate suspension of the planned mass protest in Abuja and environs by students of National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN). Akpan, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Abuja, said the planned protest which was initiated by one Bamigbade Taiwo, did not follow due process. He said the mass action, which was conveyed in a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari did not have the backing and support of NANS. “I want to clearly and categorically inform President Buhari and the general public that neither the letter nor the planned mass action emanated from the association. “The writer is an impostor of one of the executive offices of NANS, which elections will be slated in the coming emergency senate sitting in September. “He has been reprimanded and duly apologised for his actions via his facebook page – Bamigbade Taiwo Egalitarian. “Hence, the planned mass action is suspended forthwith. It will only be considered when every channel and avenue for peaceful resolution and consultation is exhausted,’’ The NANS president stressed. However, Akpan said that NANS felt the pains of the aggrieved students and sympathised with them. He also affirmed that consultations with the management of NOUN and relevant stakeholders to resolve their various grievances would immediately commence. “Therefore, students of NOUN should disregard and stay away from the planned mass action of 27th-31st Aug. 27 to Aug. 31, and go about their normal academic activities. “I want to assure them that the NANS Presidency is ever willing and ready to address their grievances and fully protect their interests.’’ NAN reports that the NOUN Law graduate students were calling on the Federal Government to intervene in the crisis between them and the Law School. The NOUN law students were denied admission into Law School.  (NAN)
