ABUJA (Sundiata Post) – The Alliance For New Nigeria (ANN) has condemned the incessant harassment of journalists and media houses by the government agencies under this administration. The party, in a statement by its publicity secretary, Akinloye Oyeniyi, said that: “The arrest of Samuel Ogundipe of Premium Times by the Nigeria Police is unwarranted and unacceptable in any democracy.” The statement further emphasised the Code of Ethics for NigerianJournalists code-named Ilorin Declaration 1998, Code 4 Sub (i) which covers all journalists. According to the Code of Ethics: “A journalist should observe the universally accepted principle of confidentiality and should not disclose the source of information obtained in confidence.” The party, therefore, called for immediate and unconditional release of the reporter languishing in the Police cell.
