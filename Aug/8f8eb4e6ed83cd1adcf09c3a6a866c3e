By Ijeoma Okigbo Asaba – Nigeria will be joining other countries to bid for the World Senior Championships of 2025, Ibrahim Gusau, the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) president, said on Saturday in Asaba. Gusau, at a press conference at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, said he was confident that the city of Abuja would be a perfect venue to choose to host the event. “The Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) president is thinking of six countries in Africa as prospective host sites for 2025. “So, I whispered to the Minister of Youths and Sports, Solomon Dalung, that we should bid for it. I can now confirm to you that we gave our intention to bid for the 2025 Championships in Abuja. “The National Stadium in Abuja is undergoing renovation, though not for the purpose of this championships. But we are hoping to take advantage of that. “New railway tracks have been put in place in Abuja. So, transportation as well as hotel accommodation will not be a problem. “If we are ready to host Africa in Asaba in 2018, by 2025 I think we should be ready to host the world,’’ Gusau said. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that no African city or country has ever hosted the World Senior Athletics Championships.(NAN)
