By Joy Kaka  Abuja,   –     A Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, on Wednesday ordered one Abdullahi Saleh to pay his former wife, Abubakar Rabi’s antenatal bills until she delivers her baby. ‎ The judge, Abdulwahab‎ Mohammed, ordered Saleh to pay N27, 710 which was the amount his former wife, Rabi spent on her antenatal and subsequently pay the bills until she delivers the baby. He also directed Saleh to get a befitting accommodation for Rabi in Kubwa and also pay N35, 000 monthly feeding ‎allowance from July until the time she puts to bed. Mohammed said that Saleh, who is the defendant in the case has right to appeal to the Sharia Court of Appeal, if he is not satisfied with the court’s judgement‎ within 30 days from Aug. 8. ‎ Rabi had earlier ‎approached the court to compel Saleh to provide feeding allowance of N35, 000 monthly, N250, 000 to renew her rent and N11,000 to settle her antenatal care bills. Saleh however said he could not afford a monthly allowance of N35, 000 and asked for receipts for the said antenatal bills. Rabi, who is carrying an eight months pregnancy got married to Saleh on April 29, 2017 and divorced him in May, 2018.
