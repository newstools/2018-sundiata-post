By Deborah Akpede  Ikeja   –       A 35-year-old driver, Rasaq Jimoh, was on Tuesday arraigned in an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly stealing a vehicle valued at N850,000.
Jimoh, who resides at Agbado Oke-Aro, was docked on a three-count charge bordering on conspiracy, forgery and stealing, offences he denied committing.
The Magistrate, Mrs F.F. George granted bail to the accused in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. George said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government.
According to the prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Awase, the accused committed the offences on July 6, at Iju-Ishaga, Lagos.
He said that the accused conspired with one Rasak Sodunke, a mechanic, to steal the bus belonging to Mr Ayo Aderounmu.
“The complainant gave his vehicle to Jimoh on hire purchase to be paying N15, 000 weekly.
“Efforts made by the complainant to get the weekly money or retrieve the vehicle proved unsuccessful as Jimoh refused to answer his calls.”
Awase said that the complainant received information from a reliable source that his vehicle had been sold.
“The complainant later discovered that Jimoh conspired with Sodunke to forge the vehicle document and sold it to one Kazeem Ayinla in Ilorin.
“The accused was arrested and handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said.
The offences contravened Section 287, 365 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 carries three years jail term for stealing, while Section 365 attracts three years for forgery.
The case was adjourned until Sept. 10 for mention.
