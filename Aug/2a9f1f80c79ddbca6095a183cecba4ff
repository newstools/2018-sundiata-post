By Ahmed Ubandoma Katsina –   The wife of the President, Mrs Aisha Buhari, has called for moral and financial support to rural women to enable them establish small scale businesses.
Mrs Buhari made the appeal on Friday while disbursing some cash to 200 women beneficiaries at the women multipurpose centre in Katsina.
The women benefitted from the Aisha Buhari Foundation’s Community-Based Cash Transfer Intervention.
She explained that it was in continuation of a similar gesture made in Daura where 200 women were assisted with cash to grow their business.
The cash distribution was executed through her NGO, the Future Assured Initiative, which is a component of Aisha Buhari Foundation.
She said that the gesture became necessary considering the economic challenge facing women at the grassroots.
Represented by Dr Mohammed Kamal, the National Coordinator of Future Assured Initiative, Mrs Buhari said the cash transfer scheme was in line with the vision of her NGO towards improving the economic status of women in Nigeria.
The state Commissioner for Women Affairs, Mrs Badiyya Hassan Mashi, thanked the wife of the president for her continued support to rural women.
The commissioner noted that the intervention would assist entrepreneurial women to expand the capital base of their micro businesses.
She therefore urged the beneficiaries to utilise the funds judiciously.  (NAN)
