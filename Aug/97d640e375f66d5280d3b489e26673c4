By Ikechukwu Iweajunwa Owerri –   The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in collaboration with the Nigeria Optometrists Association (NOA) on Friday conducted eye screening for 200 drivers with the Imo Timber and Allied Drivers Association (ITADA). The Imo command of the corps also held a mega rally and enlightenment programme for the drivers in Owerri. Speaking at the event, Mr Joseph Aremu, the Sector Commander, FRSC Imo command, said the free eye screening and the mega rally were part of activities to mark the end of Eid-el-Kabir patrol. Aremu said that the screening provided the drivers the opportunity to know their eye status and to commence treatment immediately. He said that poor sight was among major factors responsible for road traffic crashes, adding that the command was determined to ensure road safety. In and interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Dr Patrick Iwuchukwu, NOA Secretary in Imo and head of the team of optometrists, said that a driver with bad vision would be constrained and unable to take quick decision in an emergency. Iwuchukwu told NAN that at the end of the exercise, some of the drivers diagnosed with poor sight would be referred for comprehensive examination, while glasses may be recommended to others, if necessary. He said that every driver should undergo a comprehensive eye test before being certified fit to drive. In a remark, the Chairman of the drivers association, Mr Greg Udokwu, commended FRSC for the medical outreach and promised that the drivers would endeavour to maintain traffic rules. He said that poor road network, double taxation by government agencies and molestation were part of their challenges on the roads.  (NAN)
