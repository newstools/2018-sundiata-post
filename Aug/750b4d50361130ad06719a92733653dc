By Diana Omueza  Abuja –   The Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party (ANRP) says national security and national interest must always be part of rule of law for Nigeria’s democracy to be meaningful. National Publicity Secretary of party, Mr Sesugh Akume, said this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, against the backdrop of President Muhammadu Buhari’s remarks at the opening of 2018 Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) Annual General Conference on Monday. He said that it would amount to a recipe for tyranny if national security and national interest overrode supremacy of the 1999 Constitution and the Rule of Law. Akume said that the president’s address at the conference was inconsistent with the universal application of the rule of law over and above “Rule of Man”. He advised that care should be applied to ensure that the key tenets of democracy were properly observed in Nigeria. “The president’s unfortunate address at the Nigerian Bar Association’s conference is an opening for ‘rule of man’ instead of the rule of law. “Such a statement can be a ploy to re-enact Decrees 2 and 4 to give justification for blatantly violating court judgments, undermining the judiciary and refusing to give due recourse to the legislature. “Without the supremacy of the constitution in place, we will have no democracy as our civil rule is called,” he said. Akume said the president’s statement could not detract from the notion that it was justifying and serving as a cover up for the Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun, who should clear her name against an allegation of forgery. He, however, urged Nigerians to participate in the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) and obtain their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) before the Aug. 31 deadline of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Akume also urged Nigerians to ensure that they were not disenfranchised in the general elections so as to enable them to vote for the change they were clamouring for. (NAN)
