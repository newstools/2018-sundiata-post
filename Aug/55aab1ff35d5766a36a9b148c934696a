By Ariwodola Idowu Ado Ekiti –   The John Kayode Fayemi (JKF) Centre, a leadership organisation founded by Ekiti governor-elect, Dr Kayode Fayemi, says the on-going recruitment exercise by the Ayo Fayose administration is illegal. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that hundreds of unemployed graduates on Thursday besieged the State Secretariat to buy forms. The state government said 2,000 workers would be employed made up of 600 Secondary School teachers, 400 Primary School teachers and 1,000 core civil servants. Those who thronged the state Civil Service Commission, Teaching Service Commission and the State Universal Basic Education offices as early as 8:00 am included university and polytechnic graduates. But the Director of the Ado-Ekiti-based JFK Centre, Mr Biodun Omoleye, warned the applicants against buying the employment forms. He accused the outgoing governor of deliberately exploiting jobless youths by asking them to pay between N500 and N1,000 to obtain the employment forms. Omoleye alleged that Fayose was only recruiting members of his ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in flagrant violation of extant rules. ” Fayose knows that such recruitment will be cancelled by the incoming administration over the illegality that informed the exercise ” It is unlawful and wicked to play to the gallery by singling out only PDP members for recruitment ” This is a clear breach of the law that prohibits political consideration in civil service recruitment,’’ he said. He urged the applicants to disregard the employment exercise and wait till October when the new government would take over and make public his employment agenda. (NAN)
