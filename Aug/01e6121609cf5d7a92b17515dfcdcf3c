By Chibuike Nwabuko  Abuja (Sundiata Post) –  Senatorial aspirant for Zone C,  Benue State, Chief Mike Okibe Onoja, has denied media reports credited to him against Senator David Mara. In a press statement issued by his campaign organization, in Abuja, signed by his media aides, Agbo Adah, the former permanent secretary, ministry of defence, states that, “My attention has been drawn to news headlines making rounds to the effect that i will not step down for Senator David Alechenu Mark, the former President of the senate in the 2019 general election’’  Continued , he stated that  ‘’ we want to categorically state that they could just be an inference drawn by the Pilot Newspapers reporter, from an answer to one of the questions during his engagement with journalists in Benue.  The question he said has to do with what they considered his relative disadvantage in a contest against other emerging aspirants in the senatorial district’’.  According to the campaign organization, ‘’ the headline is not only misleading but sensational targeted at causing a rift between him and the distinguished Senator representing Zone C in the National Assembly.  ‘’There was nowhere in the course of the interactions that Senator Mark mentioned  any aspirants for that matter’’  ‘’For avoidance of doubt, Senator Mark,  is one of the illustrious sons of Idoma land and Benue state.  I wish to make it clear that I hold Senator Mark in high esteem, as a brother and that the relationship between Onoja and Senator Mark is very cordial and mutually respectful”.  He therefore reiterates his respect for Senator Mark and all other aspirants in the race, who he considered are in the struggle to contribute to the development of Benue state and Zone C and Nigeria in particular’’ The statement concluded.
