By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Senator representing Kaduna Central senatorial district at the National Assembly,  Senator Shehu Sani has been suspended indefinitely from the All Progressives Congress. His suspension came few days after he recanted on his planned defection from the party. The letter dated 31st July 2018 suspending the Kaduna Central senator was signed by the  party Chairman (ward 6), Ibrahim Salisu Togo. The statement reads on part: “In  all fairness to the party and Kaduna Voters, the only pre-condition for lifting the suspension on @ShehuSani  is for the lawmaker to openly apologise to the leadership of our great party for his various acts of misconduct and disrespectful attitudes towards both his constituents, party leadership and his vicious media attacks against our amiable President Muhammadu Buhari. He should also apologise to the Government and people of Kaduna State for frustrating the $350 million loan meant to develop the state in the areas of Education, healthcare delivery, works and housing, Women and Youth empowerment among others. Recall that Senator Shehu Sani has been involved in tussle for supremacy and grass-root popularity test with the governor of the state, Mallam Nasir El’rufai.
