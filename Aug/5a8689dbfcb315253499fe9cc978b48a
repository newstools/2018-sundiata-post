By Ngozi Njoku  Lagos   –    A trader, Ajibade Hammed and a student, Olajuwon Shittu, were on Thursday brought before an
Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly stabbing a hotel manager with a broken bottle. Ajibade, 30, who resides at Salami Street, Oshodi and Olajuwon, 27, who lives at Ile-Ibadan, Ishaga, a Lagos suburb, are facing a
two-count charge bordering on assault. The duo committed the offences on July 22 at Ifelotudo Street, Ifako, Gbagada, Police Prosecutor Lucky Ihiehie told the court. Ihiehie said the complainant, Mr Ogunbanewo Olusegun, the Manager of 18 Plus Hotel located at Ifelotudo Street by Sawmill at
Ifako, Gbagada, was called to come and settle a quarrel between a customer and one of his staff members. He said Ajibade pushed a waiter down and slapped him because he asked for permission to pass in a bid to serve other customers. “The hotel bouncer, Gbariel John, was called in to settle the quarrel before Olajuwon and Ajibade pounced on him and started beating
him. “The manager came to intervene and Olajuwon broke a bottle and stabbed him on the right shoulder.” The offences contravened Sections 172 and 173 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that both sections provide three years for offenders. The accused, however, denied the charges. In her ruling, the Magistrate, Mrs E. Kubeinje, granted the men N100,000 bail each and two sureties each. She said the sureties should be gainfully employed with an evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until Aug. 22 for hearing.
