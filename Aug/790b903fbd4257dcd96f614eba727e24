By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) â€“ The case against the illegal and forceful reopening of the senate chambers will come up this morning at Federal High Court, Abuja.  Recall that on Tuesday, 7th August, 2018, the operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS), took over the entrances of the National Assembly, preventing the law-makers, National Assembly workers and journalists from gaining entrance into the premises.  The masked DSS men armed to the teeth with sophisticated weapon, were allegedly deployed to provide cover to a handful of lawmakers to carry out impeachment of the senate president, Dr Bukola Saraki and his deputy, Senator Ike Ekweremadu.  Sundiata Post recalls that upon enquiry from the security operatives why they barricaded the entrances of the assembly, the officers said it was the order from above.  The Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo who denied knowledge of the DSS siege at the National Assembly and described it as illegal, immediately summoned and fired the Director General, Mr Lawal Daura.  Recall that the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had shortly after the presidency announced a 10- day working leave of President Muhamnadu Buhari to London raised the alarm that it has it in good authority there was alleged plot to forcefully and illegally remove Saraki and Ekweremadu while the president is away.  The party accused the presidency and ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) of masterminding the plot.
