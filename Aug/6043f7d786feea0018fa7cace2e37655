ABUJA (Sundiata Post)     –      The Advocacy for Integrity and Economic Development (AIED) has called on Acting President Yemi Osinbajo to terminate the appointment of the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, over the unlawful arrest and detention of Premium Times’ reporter, Samuel Ogundipe. The organisation in a statement on Thursday by its Director of Media and Publicity, Comrade O’Seun John, described the continuous incarceration of the reporter as an assassination of the values of democracy and a stampede on Press Freedom. “We were shocked to receive news of the unlawful detention of Samuel Ogundipe, one of the finest investigative reporter in Nigeria who has only dedicated his time to revealing the truth at all times. “We find it incomprehensible that this illegality took place at a time the Acting President, Professor Yemi Osinbajo – a senior minister in the temple of justice – is making efforts (to) reform the scattered structure of the Nigeria Police Force. “This act in itself is nothing other than treason as it undermines the office of the Acting President and brings ridicule to the Presidency. “We believe strongly in the face of glaring evidences of gross abuse against human rights and total disregard for the tenets of law that the Inspector General of Police has outlived his usefulness in office and his appointment should be terminated without delay,” the statement said.
