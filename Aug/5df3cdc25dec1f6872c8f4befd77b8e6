By Chibuike Nwabuko Abuja (Sundiata Post) – Members of the House of Representatives in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) have raised the alarm over an alleged plan to impeach Senate President Bukola Saraki “through the back door”. The lawmakers said some All Progressives Congress (APC) senators were plotting to invade the senate chamber and impeach Saraki on Wednesday night. Recall that Saraki defected from the APC to the PDP on Tuesday, after Comrade Adams Oshiomhole led National Working Committee dissolved the Kwara State party in an attempt to weaken the camp of the senate President and his loyalists in the state. Recall that Senate President has been having it rough with the party since his emergence as the senate president against the anointed candidate of the party. Addressing journalists at the national assembly complex, Chukwuka Onyema, chairman of the PDP caucus and deputy house minority leader, said the lawmakers learnt the senators were plotting to carry out the act in connivance with security agencies. “The aim of their invasion in the senate while senators are on recess is to come and sit illegally and impeach the senate president,” Onyema said. “We also have it on good authority that they are planning to come back this night and tomorrow morning aided by security force, he added. “We might think they want to take over the senate but that’s not what they want to do. They want to truncate this democracy of ours. “But we, the PDP caucus have decided to stay here to keep vigil and wait to see what is going to happen tonight and tomorrow night.” Both chambers of the national assembly are currently on recess which is expected to end in September.
