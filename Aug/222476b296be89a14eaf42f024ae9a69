By Kate Obande-Okewu  Abuja   –       SERVICOM is to re-evaluate Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to check the level of improvement in service delivery, Mrs Nnenna Akajemeli, National Coordinator of the srvice said. Akajemeli made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja. She said that the re-evaluation was necessary to check the level of improvement in service delivery and to find out if the MDAs adhered to SERVICOM’s recommendations. “From evaluation, we submit reports to the management of the MDAs and then make recommendations on ways to fill in the gaps discovered. “In the cause of submitting reports issues may arise and some of these issues bothers on training, decentralisation of their processes and reducing number of days for accessing specific services. “These are the things we go back to check from time to time and it’s a continuous process and we also track progress for sustained improvement”, she said. She added that some of the organisations were referred to the SERVICOM institute for service improvement training, but if they can’t make it to the institute we go to their offices and train them. NAN gathered that the MDAs evaluated in the past were Government Hospitals, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control(NAFDAC), National Open Universities of Nigeria, Federal Airport Authorities (FAAN) among others.
