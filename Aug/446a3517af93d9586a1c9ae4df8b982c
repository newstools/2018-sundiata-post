By Martha Agas  Barkin-Ladi    –     A Non-Governmental Organisation, Voice for Sisters Empowerment Foundation based in Jos on Tuesday says it has concluded arrangements to
organise skills acquisition programme for women in Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)
camp in Heipang, Barkin Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau. The Founder of the organisation, Mrs Abiola Dejo-Richards, made this known when she visited
the camp to donate food items and toiletries to the IDPs. She said that majority of the IDPs were women who required economic empowerment to provide for their children and also the sick and elderly left in their care. Represented by Mrs Adefunke Treasure, the Plateau Coordinator of the NGO, Dejo-Richards
said that the empowerment would commence at their subsequent visit. She said “we have collated the number of women and youths and would return to organise skills acquisition programme on beads making, disinfectants and soap making, among others. “We urge government to ensure speedy resettlement of the IDPs through reinforced commitment to protect lives and property.” Dejo-Richards noted that the camp located at Church Of Christ In Nations (COCIN) was in dire need of clothing for the children and food to prevent malnourishment. The camp Coordinator, Mr Gyang Emmanuel, who received the donation commended the NGO
for the gesture. He said that the support was an indication of the fact that Nigerians were their brother’s keepers and prayed for peace in Plateau, pointing out that there would be no meaningful development in any society without peace. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports than more than 2,000 IDPs from 10 villages in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area are taking refuge in the camp . The camp was established by the state government after the June 23 attack on three local government areas of Plateau, where scores were killed and thousands were displaced. The organisation donated food items such as rice, noodles, spaghetti, as well as toiletries.
