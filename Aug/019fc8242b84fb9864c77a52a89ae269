The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Oseni-Gomez ventured into partisan politics in 1999 and was elected as the first female Speaker of Ogun Assembly,June 2013. The former speaker was received by the ADC chieftain, Mr Joju Fadairo, a former chairman of PDP in the state and also ADC governorship aspirant, Mr Nasir Isiaka. “After series of consultations across political circles and associates, discussions with leaders and people of my senatorial districts, I decided to join forces with reformists by pitching my tent with ADC. “The party is committed to unity, good governance and equal opportunity,’’ she said. She noted that the quest for responsible and responsive government had always been an important part of her life. “It has always been my wish to assuage the challenges of my people and contribute my little quota toward societal development. “I am primarily in politics to provide quality leadership and worthy representation by partaking in formulation of policies that will be beneficial to my constituents, state and the nation in general.’’ She urged members of the party to mobilise their people to register for the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), to enable them vote in the 2019 elections.
