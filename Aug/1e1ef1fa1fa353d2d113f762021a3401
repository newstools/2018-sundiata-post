The maid also alleged that she was gagged and blindfolded by the hoodlums before they killed her madam. She said, “I was working when the boys entered the house. I wanted to shout and one of them wanted to stab me. ‘‘Another one said I was still a small girl; they tried to rape me but I said no. “I heard a noise but I didn’t see what they were doing. ‘‘Then, they put a stone on my hand and asked me to say I kill mama.” However, the son of the deceased, who gave his name as Harrison Udugbezi, told NAN that he was surprised that his mother was killed in such a brutal manner.
