By Habibu Harisu Sokoto –   The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar III, has urged youths corps members not to be distracted by security challenges, but should always pursue issues that would contribute to the development of the nation. Abubakar made the call on Monday at his Palace in Sokoto during an interactive session with the 2018 NYSC batch ‘B’ Corp members posted to the state. He also urged the corps members to interact freely with members of their host communities, understand their values and respect them. The Sultan said the NYSC was a very importance scheme as it promoted national cohesion. He also called on the NYSC authorities to revive the Endurance Trek and other physical exercise for corps members in order to prepare them for greater tasks in life. The NYSC Coordinator in the state, Mr Philip Enaburue, said 2,154 corps members were registered at the 2018 batch B orientation camp in the area and that they came from the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. Enaburue commended the Sultan for his support for the scheme in the state. (NAN)
