By Uwumarogie Peter  Gombe    –        A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Gombe, Mr Inuwa Yahaya, has advised youths against using elections as a window for violence. Yahaya gave this advice in an interview with newsmen on Sunday in Gombe. He said that the culture of violence during elections was as a result of the negative perception of some youths toward elections. According to him, some youths have become vulnerable tools in the hands of politicians because they are ignorant of the harm violence does to the society. He said that the various political parties should let their followers realise that election was an important democratic process that could flourish under a peaceful atmosphere. “The perception of some youths toward election over the years is that of fomenting violence during elections. “Many of them do not know the harm that violence can do to the society in the future. “The truth is that the future of the nation belongs to the youths so if Nigeria is destroyed, what will be the fate of the youths in the nearest future?’’ Yahaya said that party chieftains should also educate their supporters on good conduct before, during and after elections. “If the society is destroyed or is in chaos, how will governance be done? “I advise that as the 2019 general election draws near, youths should see it as a democratic process that must be devoid of violence if they hope to reap the dividends of democracy.’’ He advised youths to also cast their votes on election days for the candidates of their choices, adding,“ If we cultivate this Nigeria will be a better place. “I also advise party members to learn to see politics as a game in which winning is not always guaranteed every time. Nigeria is our home and we must guard it jealously’’, he said. Yahaya also appealed to the youths to register and collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) for them to exercise their voting rights in 2019.
