By Deborah Akpede  Ikeja   –     A 26-year-old employee, Isaac Ayoke, who pleaded guilty to stealing his employer’s N1million was on Tuesday remanded at Kirikiri Prisons in Lagos on the orders of an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The magistrate, Mrs F.F. George, ordered the remand of the accused, who resides at Ajah in Lagos State pending the review of facts and sentencing at the next date of adjournment. The magistrate then adjourned the case until Sept. 12. Earlier, the prosecutor, Sgt. Godwin Awase, had told the court that the accused committed a two-count charge of burglary and stealing on July 7 at Mushin in Lagos State. He said that the accused burgled the one of the offices of GHL Glass Tech Nigeria Ltd., where he stole N1million. “The accused, after closing hours broke the ceiling to gain entrance into the office where the money was kept. “He carted away with the money and refused to report for work the following day.” Awase said that the burglary and theft were recorded by the Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) camera installed within the company. “The management played the CCTV camera and discovered that the accused was the culprit. “They went in search of him, caught him in his brother’s place where the money was recovered from him. “He was handed over to the police,” the prosecutor said. The accused, who confessed to the crime, attributed it to the handiwork of the devil, and pleaded for mercy. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 287 and 307 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 prescribes three years’ imprisonment for stealing while Section 307 carries seven years’ penalty for burglary.
