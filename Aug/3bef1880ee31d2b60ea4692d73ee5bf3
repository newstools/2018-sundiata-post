By Adenike Omotoyinbo  Ikeja   –      A 27-year-old unemployed, Abayomi Babajide, who allegedly jumped over a fence into a building with an intent to steal, was on Friday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. Babajide, whose residential address was not provided, is being charged with felony. The prosecutor, Sgt. Nomayo Kenrich, told the court that the accused committed the offence on July 27 about 11.35 p. m., at No. 5, Amoo St., Orile-Agege, a Lagos suburb. Kenrich said the accused, unlawfully, gained access into the compound of the complainants: Muyideen Omotosho, Gabriel Adigun and Idris Amusa. “The accused was pursued through several streets by the public until he was caught by the residents of Amoo Street,’’ he said. The prosecutor said that the offence contravened Section 21 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015, (Revised). The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the section stipulates two years imprisonment for offenders. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The chief magistrate, Mr T. O. Ojo, granted the accused bail in the sum of N30, 000 with one surety in the like sum. Ojo said the surety must be gainfully employed with an evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He said the surety address must be verified by the court as part of his bail conditions. The magistrate adjourned the case until Aug. 15 for mention.
