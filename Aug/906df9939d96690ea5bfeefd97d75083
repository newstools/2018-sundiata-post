By Ibrahim Kado Lawanti (Gombe) –   Brig. Gen. Suleiman Kazaure, the Director General of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), has advised Corps members to ensure good hygiene to remain healthy at all times. The DG gave the advice during his visit to the 2018 Batch ‘B’ corps members deployed to Gombe State, at the temporary orientation camp, Amada, in Akko Local Government Area of the State on Monday. Kazaure, who was represented by Director, Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development, Mr Nuhu Kwaghe, urged the corps members to imbibe the culture of hand washing to prevent infection. “Please obey hygiene rules to remain healthy at all times, because it will help you and help us,” he said. Kazaure urged them to eat what NYSC provides to them and watch what they eat outside this to stay healthy. He called on them to obey the instructions of camp officials for a successful orientation programme and to acquire skills that would enable them to be self-employed. The DG urged them to take it serious for their advantage after the service year, and also to play their part in ensuring security in the state and the nation in general. He warned them to avoid travelling without permission. Mr David Markson, the state coordinator, stated that a total of 1,474 Corps members were registered at the camp and 109 were relocated on grounds of health, pregnancy and being nursing mothers. He disclosed that a lot of work had been done before the commencement of the orientation course, considering the temporary nature of the camp. “We renovated toilets, camp kitchen, collapsed the pavilion and constructed additional one to contain all corps members during the lectures,” he said.
