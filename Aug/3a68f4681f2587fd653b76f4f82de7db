By Rita Iliya  Minna   –     Supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Niger on Sunday thronged Minna/Suleja road in solidarity with Gov. Abubakar Bello of Niger and President Muhammadu Buhari. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Bello and his counterpart, Gov. Ben Ayade of Cross River, had on July 29, accompanied President Buhari to attend Heads of Governments of ECOWAS States meeting in Togo. The governor, who was on his way from Kaduna to Minna after attending an official assignment in Zaira, was received by his Deputy, Alhaji Ahmed Ketso, APC chieftains, delegates and supporters across the 25 local government areas of the state. Passengers in commercial and private vehicles plying the Minna/Suleja road were stranded as the road was blocked by elated supporters that chanted “Lolo two terms”. It took the governor’s motorcade three hours from Paiko to get to Minna, a journey of 15 minutes drive. NAN reports that some of the supporters carried placards with inscription such as “Lolo 2019 yes, 2019 Lolo, continuity of government projects, 2019, sai Buhari”. Malam Shehu Mohammed, one of the supporters who spoke to NAN, said that the warm reception was in solidarity with the governor and the president for meeting the aspirations of the people of the state and the country at large. “I came from Rafi Local Government Area to show my support for our governor and the president and to let them know that they should continue with the good work they are doing as they have our support,” he said.
