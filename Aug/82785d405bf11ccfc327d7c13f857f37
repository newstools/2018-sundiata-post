Ukodie, also the Chief Executive Officer of Ajomedia Ltd., an eWorld Magazine, said in a statement on Friday in Lagos that digital transformation would facilitate achievement of goals. “The more prepared an organisation or nation is, the more likely it will achieve its desired goals,’’ he said. According to him, the ninth edition of the eWorld conference will provide an opportunity for discussions on Nigeria’s readiness for digital transformation. He said that the conference, with the theme, “Nigeria’s Readiness for Digital Transformation’’, will take place in Lagos on Sept. 20. “This year’s programme is aimed at underscoring the need for Nigeria and its corporate entities to digitally prepare and transform their systems and processes to achieve their stated missions and visions. “Transformation is a process of profound and radical change that orientates an organisation or a nation in a new direction and takes it to an entirely different level of effectiveness,’’ the ICT entrepreneur said. He said that the conference would seek to provide answers to whether new technologies would be imperatives for digital transformation, and what should be the focus in Nigeria’s digital transformation bid. He said that the forum would also seek to find out the manpower imperatives for organisational and national digital transformation. “The forum will also discuss the requirements for digital transformation and the roadmap for digital transformation as well as discuss digital readiness versus digital transformation. “It will answer whether Nigeria is ready for digital transformation,” he said. He said that the forum which started in 2009 had helped the Nigerian ICT industry to chart a direction of discourse and policy formulation.
