By Peter Amine  Jos –   Chief Martin Shaldals II, the Long Goemai and paramount ruler of Shendam in Plateau, has advised his subjects eyeing the governorship seat to “talk with each other” toward harmonising their aspirations. “Talk with one another as brothers; let the interests of the people be the overriding consideration. Goemai people are civilised and must not allow politics to breed acrimony among them,” Shaldas 11 said on Friday in Shendam. The monarch spoke when Rep Johnbull Shekarau (PDP/Shendam/Mikang), one of the governorship aspirants, came to seek his blessings for the coveted seat. He cautioned aspirants against allowing their interest to tear the ethnic group apart, and emphasised the need for them to be civil, peaceful and tolerant while pursuing their political aspirations. Noting that seven indigenes of Goemai Kingdom were in the race for the position, he said that they should try to harmonise their aspirations and respect the interest of the majority. Earlier, Shekarau had told the monarch that he was at the palace to seek royal blessings, saying that he had consulted widely and was convinced that Plateau needed his service. The former Deputy Speaker of the Plateau House of Assembly, who is seeking the ticket of the PDP to unseat the incumbent, Simon Lalong, equally from the Goemai nation, expressed confidence that the PDP would win elections at all levels in 2019.
