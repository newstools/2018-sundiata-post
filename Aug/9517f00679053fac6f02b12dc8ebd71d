By Stanley Nwanosike  Enugu –   The Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) says it will embark on aggressive public enlightenment campaign to sensitise residents of Enugu State to its activities. The new Comptroller of NIS in the state, Mr Sam Chinda, disclosed this during an interactive session with newsmen in Enugu on Wednesday. Chinda said the campaign became necessary to let the people know the massive improvement in the services of the NIS. He said as part of the reforms in the organisation, the service had put in place modern facilities; hence it could now produce vital documents including Green Cards at the state command level. He said that the NIS was committed to providing quality services to both Nigerians and foreigners. ‘‘We are poised to provide quality service to the people of Enugu State. NIS has competent officers on ground who are committed to discharging their duties professionally. ‘‘The Comptroller-General of the service, Mr Muhammad Babandede, is a very pro-active officer who had brought a lot of reforms in the organisation, including tackling the issue of touting and extortion in passport services,’’ the comptroller said. He said the command would be carrying out its duties in line with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) protocol. ‘‘To this end, we are assuring ECOWAS or non-ECOWAS residents in the state with valid documents not to be worried about their stay in the country as the service will continue to respect the ECOWAS protocol at all times,’’ he said. Chinda maintained that the NIS had zero tolerance for misconduct and other forms of unprofessional behaviours among its officers and men. He, however, said that the raid of illegal immigrants in the state would be a continuous exercise, even as he advised them to regularise their documents to avoid repatriation.  (NAN)
